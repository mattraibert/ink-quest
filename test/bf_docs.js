      '<blockquote>\n<div>\n<p><i>There must be a room, sealed against the present, before we can make any attempt to deal with the past.<br />\n</i>— Thomas Pynchon, <i>V.</i></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p> So many characters in twentieth-century literature are absorbed into narrative scenery or lost to the torrents of history. The uncertain ending seemed evidently suitable to novelists whose notions of fate were darkened in the years before, between, or after the World Wars. The helpless Karl Rossmann of Kafka’s unfinished <i>Amerika</i>, written between 1911 and 1914, apprehends the “vastness” of the Oklahoman wilderness in which, we may presume, he would have been lost (its alternative titles: <i>The Missing Person</i> or <i>The Man Who Disappeared</i>). The interbellum period saw the publication of Fitzgerald’s <i>Tender Is the Night</i>, in which Dick Diver flees the Riviera (and his farcical marriage) for upstate New York to live out his days “in one town or another.” The pattern continued into the postwar era. Nabokov’s befuddled Pnin adopts a stray dog and leaves the town of Waindell without specifying his “final destination.” Yet the novel persists; the poor Russian’s own story cycles on without him!  </p>\n<p>Alexander Jessiersky of <i>Count Luna</i>, published in 1955 and written by Viennese poet and novelist Alexander Lernet-Holenia, certainly belongs to this company of lost men. Living in Austria under Nazi occupation, the paranoid merchant chases a phantom through a novel of murderous blunders before absconding to Rome, where he enters the catacombs of St. Praetextatus. He is never again seen among the living.</p>\n<p>These expulsions and disappearances work nicely as culminations of the rootlessness, impotence, and somatoparaphrenia reported by the foregoing characters, sensations that inevitably attend to a terror about providence and time that intensified throughout the twentieth century. Especially after the senseless blood rituals of the World Wars, statesmen, veterans, and civilians had come to suspect that the functions of history were discontinuous and orthogonal to human concern. The proud captains of history were realizing they were, in Lernet-Holenia’s terms, “merely the instruments of fate.”  </p>\n<p>The idea found its most cogent expression in the postmodern novelists who came after Lernet-Holenia, especially Thomas Pynchon, who possesses a strikingly similar vision of time. Whereas the Austrian novelist banished his character into the decrepit maze of history, Pynchon allowed major characters to be swallowed whole by it. In the late-middle of <i>Gravity’s Rainbow</i> (1973) Tyrone Slothrop unceremoniously vanishes from the wartime narrative—just <i>gone.</i></p>\n<p>Yet Lernet-Holenia observed something besides human smallness before the indifferent leviathan of history. A pupil of Rilke, admired by Borges, Lernet-Holenia has a literary reputation as a sort of continental necromancer, a conductor of the underworldly and oneiric, uprooting tangled lineages and raising the closeted skeletons of guilty nations (Jessiersky, a monarchist privately opposed to the Third Reich’s annexation of Austria, nonetheless inherits a large estate from Count Luna after he’s sent to a concentration camp). There’s nothing flatly inaccurate about this characterization, but it can mistakenly suggest that Lernet-Holenia was exclusively preoccupied with the past. History imposes a weight upon this author’s characters, no question, but it also anchors them just behind the present moment, the bleeding edge of history that is always leaving us behind.</p>\n<p>Lernet-Holenia developed this encumbered present in an earlier novel of the First World War: <i>Baron Bagge</i>, first published in German in 1936 and now reissued in translation. The novella begins after the war’s end, as the titular baron explains to a querulous peer why he has refused to marry ever since he served the Austro-Hungarian Empire as a cavalry officer (as Lernet-Holenia did). Led by the “intemperate” and seemingly deranged Captain Semler, the Count Gondola Dragoons rode during a pitiless Hungarian winter, searching for Russians in wind-battered villages and lifeless vineyards along the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, whose slumbering volcanoes thrust up “out of the plain like a muted voice of the underworld.” </p>\n<p>Bagge’s experience of the frigid plain resembles a nightmare in which one loses and cannot regain their sight. Lernet-Holenia’s descriptions command a deathly sense of confinement; all objects in view, at hand and afar, “crowd” and “close in” upon the squadron. The consistency and logic of this imagery (impressively maintained in the translation by Richard and Clara Winston) establishes a shroud of mystification, at once literal and spiritual, that follows the Dragoons wherever they ride. Brooding daylit clouds form “dense, oppressive sheets,” “low-lying, gloomy” veils, or “blackish fog” that conspire with driving snow to “envelope,” “swath,” “hide,” and “blind.” At night, the world altogether disappears and threatens to devilishly reconfigure itself, like an opponent moving chessmen while you are away from the board. Bagge remarks, “it was possible that we would awaken in the morning to find ourselves side by side with Russians who had also camped for the night in this same vicinity.”  </p>\n<p>At last, Bagge and his squadron encounter “swarms” of Russian infantry (in Lernet-Holenia’s imagination, people share with insects a propensity for “swarming”), assembled at the far end of a bridge over the glassy Ondava River. Semler orders a sudden advance that Bagge regards as suicidal (in the First World War, antiquated calvary were regularly mowed down by machine gunners), but the Dragoons are inexplicably victorious. Given the anticipation Lernet-Holenia builds into this encounter (if there was ever a time for an author to relate the exhilarating present!), it is strange that Bagge does not describe or even remember the perilous moment.</p>\n<p>When the squadron travels to the nearby town of Vásárhely, Bagge sustains his eerie remove from the present. During a “masked ball” hosted by the locals, Bagge is transfixed by their outmoded costumes: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<p>There were comparatively few Empire [contemporary] costumes and almost no baroque ones. On the other hand, there was a swarm of old uniforms, gold-embroidered, government-official frock coats of the last century, chamberlains’ regalia, hussars’ uniforms, the befurred and bechained capes of Hungarian magnates, and, above all, the white military tunics of the old army.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>His temporal confusion deepens. Bagge meets a young woman named Charlotte, a distant family friend who somehow already knows and loves him. “The shape of her head” immediately reminds Bagge of the “heads of Egyptian rulers, elongated by the double crown.” Quickly enamored of Charlotte, Bagge glimpses the “snowy enamel” of her smile, comparing it to the flawless “teeth of Greek hetaerae in excavated graves.” As these bizarre details and allusions accrue, it seems as though Bagge were walking backwards in time, blind to the present, watching as the tidy facets of history are scrambled into an unintelligible bricolage. </p>\n<p>While the Dragoons are stationed in town, Semler’s hunt for Russians becomes increasingly desperate. The captain sends Bagge away from Charlotte, whom he recently married, to search for the enemy. “We must run into them somewhere,” Semler yells. “Otherwise we are lost!” After Bagge returns without news, Semler orders the entire squadron to decamp and begin combing the snowy plains for the brown coats of Russian soldiers. Only a few ever return from this mission.</p>\n<p>The squadron’s final journey turns supernatural, as the Dragoons begin crossing a glittering golden bridge surrounded by thundering waterfalls and heavenly rainbows. Unnerved, Bagge refuses to cross and suddenly awakens lying wounded on the bridge over which Semler ordered his foolhardy charge. The Dragoons, as initially expected, had been decimated. What Bagge experienced was, as Lernet-Holenia wrote in a letter, a version of the “myth of the nine-day journey toward death,” whose conclusion the baron only narrowly avoided (he was rescued by stragglers). In this light, it becomes clear that Semler—now enigmatic rather than insane—understood their predicament all along, and that his hunt for Russians was truly a frantic search for the present moment that only the living can access.</p>\n<p>So we learn why Bagge has refused to remarry: because of his matrimony to a ghost of a woman who, it turns out, died years before he rode into the Hungarian countryside. His commitment to an immaterial past testifies to the unreality that buoys all histories, personal and collective. Lernet-Holenia saw that we were nonetheless denizens of time, compelled to secure an identity from history through selective blindness and never-ending maintenance. As the present heaps new experience for humans to incorporate into their most cherished and fragile artifact, they trail behind the moment, weighed down and back, feeling “as though their existence already belonged to the past, so strangely, so much like ghosts did they stagger through time.”</p>\n<p>Lernet-Holenia’s ghosts are evidence of an afterlife—one that claims Jessiersky, and releases Bagge—but only the kind befitting the luckless creatures imagined by him and the novelists who shared his themes, writers whose historical nihilism was affirmed by a century of failure, degradation, bewilderment, butchery, powerlessness, and looming annihilation. It is the hereafter granted to onlookers with no sight, objects with no soul, agents with no choice, arbiters with no will, ghosts with no future. In other words, human beings without any signs of life. Don’t you get it? We’re already dead. </p>\n</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.bookforum.com/contributor/trevor-quirk" title="Contributions by Trevor Quirk">Trevor Quirk</a> is a writer living in Asheville, NC. </p>\n<p> </p>\n',

      '<p><b>ONE OF SAM LIPSYTE</b><b>’S SIGNATURE ACCOMPLISHMENTS</b> has been to find the baroque musicality in the emergent vocabularies—commercial, bureaucratic, wellness-industrial, pornographic—opened up by twenty-first-century English. “Hark would shepherd the sermon weirdward,” he writes in his 2019 novel about an entrepreneurial inspirational speaker, “the measured language fracturing, his docile flock of reasonable tips for better corporate living driven off the best practices cliff, the crowd in horrified witness.” Across his first six books, Lipsyte’s sentences have been excessive, pun-laden, and lyrically raunchy. When language threatens to sound measured, a character with a zany name can be counted on to fracture it.  </p>\n<p>Lipsyte’s latest novel, the East Village–set <i>No One Left to Come Looking for You</i>, is by contrast remarkably stripped down. Its moments of linguistic flamboyance are outnumbered by an almost screenwriterly tendency toward dialogue, and its characters talk in a clipped, plainspoken style that verges on hard-boiled. An exchange on page 1: “He left with it?” “Yeah.” “Fuck.” From such a gymnast of syntax, this reads as a compelling experiment in self-restraint. If Lipsyte formerly treated the grammars of twenty-first-century corporatism and neoimperialism as sources of elaborate wordplay, he’s now approached those subjects in a style drawn from two comparatively older and no-frills idioms: punk and noir. </p>\n<p>These genres are powerfully compatible, with their twin emphases on high-speed disorientation and seedy underworlds. Lipsyte fuses them in a shaggy plot that his characters—Gen Xers who have watched a lot of television—self-consciously refer to as “The Case of the Missing Bass.” The novel opens with a standard detective-fiction trope: a guy has disappeared, and with him an object of some significance. In this case the missing person is a beautiful Lebanese-American guitarist known as the Earl, and the MacGuffin—presumably stolen to finance the Earl’s drug habit—is a bass guitar belonging to his roommate and bandmate, Jack. Jack’s full name is Jack Shit, because their band is called the Shits. They play “post-wave neo-noise art punk with a sincere approach to irony.” It’s winter, 1993.</p>\n<p>The novel follows Jack around lower Manhattan’s grimiest bars and diners as he attempts to track down his friend with the help of a warmly sketched cast of neighborhood regulars: his bandmates, Hera and Cutwolf; Corrina, a love interest and feminist artist (“she’s going to drench me with her menstrual blood,” Jack tells his mother, proudly, after being enlisted in a video performance); and Toad Molotov, a DIY-scene elder (he’s thirty-three). It’s when Jack and Cutwolf pay Toad a visit that the plot thickens, and the novel’s noir aspirations really announce themselves.</p>\n<p>We get a tour of Toad’s apartment and a description of his T-shirt—promoting a fictional-but-plausible hardcore collective called Annihilation of the Soft Left—before reading that “blood burbles from a deep gouge in the ‘Soft,’ right over his heart.” A panoramic sweep of a room before the body is revealed to the reader: this is a signature innovation of Raymond Chandler. And Jack—intuiting that Toad’s killer, a menacing stranger named (here’s the Lipsyte touch) Heidegger, has something to do with his missing bandmate—is conscripted into the role of anxious Philip Marlowe. His search takes on a personal urgency: if his frontman is dead, so is their band, which Jack loves earnestly and devotedly. “The Shits are a writhing, shimmering society of the spectacle,” he reflects. He “still believe[s] in the vision that the Shits, whatever their current or future configuration, will bring to the table of innovative and eccentric guitar-based noise rock, a field, or table, that doesn’t support a lot of careers but one that maybe rewards a few diligent and talented practitioners.” </p>\n<p>Like Milo Burke, the failed painter who narrates Lipsyte’s 2010 novel <i>The Ask</i>, Jack is an appealingly digressive New Jersey–born slacker, passionate about an art form he might not be very good at. The two protagonists occupy starkly different Manhattans: where <i>The Ask</i>’s New York is a post-recessional tableau of drab conference rooms and fast-casual sandwich chains, <i>No One Left to Come Looking for You</i> seems genuinely fond of its gritty East Village mise-en-scène, described by Jack with the spirited familiarity of someone who rarely strays from its blocks. (“I haven’t been this far uptown in a few years,” he thinks, crossing Fourteenth Street. “This is the New York I always figured the counterculture was counter to.”) But Jack and Milo share the same lofty critical vocabulary—like Lipsyte, both attended college at the peak of high theory—and a sense of dread about the waning artistic ambitions of their youths. And both throw themselves eagerly into their self-assigned missions, approaching the mysteries at the heart of their respective novels with an enthusiasm and pluck that only the underemployed could muster. </p>\n<p>The paradigmatic noir protagonist is the private detective, an archetype suspended, as the film critic Raymond Borde wrote in his 1955 study of the genre, “midway between order and crime.” Possessing both the institutional know-how of the police and the antiauthoritarian spirit of the outlaws he pursues, the Philip Marlowe or Continental Op type must in any situation maintain an appearance of capability: he can talk smoothly, drink mightily, and withstand the essential mystification built into his genre, getting to the bottom of things even while he’s being tailed or whacked on the head with a pipe. Thomas Pynchon’s <i>Inherent Vice</i>—a clear predecessor of Lipsyte’s novel—spectacularly demonstrated that noir can accommodate the paranoia of multinational corporate capture and weed. But even the perpetually stoned Doc Sportello possesses a certain detached competence and irrepressible cool. </p>\n<p>Jack Shit, on the other hand, is more idealistic than a good PI should be. Faced with situations in which he might charm, lie, or flirt his way into information that could help locate his friend, he gets nervous and starts opining about Iggy Pop. Punk has failed to prepare him to talk to scary hitmen, let alone to the pigs; when he does end up around cops, he adopts a haphazard private-eye lingo borrowed from <i>Miami Vice</i>. (“Detective, I think I’ve made a break in the case,” he announces. “Isn’t that how you guys say it?”) Also, he’s really worked up about his missing roommate and keeps bursting into tears. If Jonathan Ames’s novella <i>Bored to Death</i> posed the formal question of whether noir can be neurotic, Lipsyte, a gifted chronicler of American neurosis, has answered in the affirmative by writing his usual character—a goofy underachiever—into a genre that greets him with open hostility.</p>\n</p>\n<div class="article-image-container">\n<div class="blog-article__image blog-article__image--landscape">\n        <af-more-images-link :article-id="25145" :image-id="60372" article-title="DIY PI" :image-names=\'["article"]\'><br />\n                        <img decoding="async" src="//www.bookforum.com/uploads/upload.000/id25145/article00_1064x.jpg" alt="Ash Thayer, Matty, View from Serenity Roof #2, 1997, materials variable, 40 × 60”.

Courtesy the artist<br />\n        </figcaption></div>\n</div>\n<p><b>LIPSYTE</b><b>’S EXPERIMENT IN</b> hard-boiled hardcore manages to take its self-imposed conventions somewhere more playful and less pointlessly nostalgic than have similar genre exercises by his contemporaries, such as Jonathan Lethem’s latest inane foray into crime fiction, 2018’s <i>The Feral Detective</i>. Lipsyte approaches noir—a solidly twentieth-century form, like punk—with a self-conscious belatedness that his characters begin to share. “What the hell were we thinking,” Jack wonders as his search for the Earl grows increasingly futile, </p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<p>all of us kids who moved to New York years too late, wearing the superannuated styles, doing the old, dirty drugs, coaxing the classic roar from our tube amps? In other precincts of the city, young people dance and heave to a modern throb in a whirl of rum-and-cokes and coke. Uptown, and in the boroughs, new rap galaxies explode into being. But here we are, sad stragglers, knockoffs, ensorcelled by the wizened gods. What gives? </p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is an elegy written in 2022, set in 1993, for a musical genre from the ’70s, in a literary style that emerged in the ’40s. The more Jack worries about being two decades late to the party (“You get to live in your sweet, protected world, your little dirtbag Disneyland,” a cop sneers at him. “You move in and pretend it’s nineteen seventy-six, but it’s not”), the clearer it becomes that simulation and anachronism are the point. Every genre has its long tail, its unlikely imitators and resurgences.</p>\n<p>But Jack is right to feel that the DIY era, like the Shits, might be coming to an end. In the background of the novel’s East Village setting looms the threat of gentrification, of an NYU-decimated neighborhood with plenty of fast-casual sandwiches and not very much punk at all. An alarm bell rings when, in the kind of detour that would take Philip Marlowe to Tijuana but brings Jack to New Jersey, he runs into a novelist (the author of a “prizewinning campus parable” and a “postmodern sex-and-football satire”) who delivers an apocalyptic tirade after seeing a famous real-estate developer on television: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<p>He’s a symptom of the decay. The moral decay. The civic decay. The city’s been bought up by bastards like this. Someday there will be no ordinary neighborhoods. Just the ultra-rich and their urban serfs. . . . Of course, all civilizations are soaked in blood. Egypt. Babylon. Athens. Rome. Tenochtitlán. Berlin. Moscow. It’s never not been a gruesome, stabby death orgy. </p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s interesting that Lipsyte sounds most like himself—nobody else could pull off “stabby death orgy”—when doing a pastiche of Don DeLillo, but the point of the passage is the tycoon on TV: “a familiar-looking man in a power suit with a protruding lower lip and a sweep of blond hair.” </p>\n<p>An appearance of Donald Trump halfway through a work of literary fiction might irk readers worn down by novels that jump the shark and land among the pandemics and anti-ICE protests of contemporaneity. But Lipsyte has written a “Trump novel” only insofar as Trump suits his purposes. Trump functions here less as a specter of electoral dread than as the ultimate landlord, a neighborhood-destroying sellout and the head of a real-estate conspiracy that goes all the way to the top: the Earl, we learn, has become collateral damage in a murky white-collar conflict over land use and labor, one set in motion by the future president himself. That Lipsyte’s scrappy and provincial protagonist—too busy fretting about the last days of DIY to nail one of the “rich, crooked fucks who run this city”—might have foreclosed the 2016 election is the novel’s great, mournful punch line. Like his band, Jack is too small not to fail. </p>\n<p>In <i>A Panorama of American Film Noir</i>, Borde writes that a principal goal of noir is to “shed light on forbidden worlds.” Lipsyte, alert to the challenges of retrofitting his chosen genre for the near present, spends most of his novel allowing us to think his “forbidden world” is a fading downtown DIY scene. But underworlds don’t look the way they used to, and true crime isn’t drug use or power chords. It’s not even fictional villainous corporations. More dramatically than even Pynchon, who had to invent a vertically integrated crime syndicate with <i>Inherent Vice</i>’s Golden Fang, Lipsyte has updated the detective novel for the billionaire era by lifting his antagonist straight from life. In doing so, he ends on an insight worthy of his theory-spouting protagonists: the real crime is financialized property ownership; the underworld worth illuminating is a rapacious real-estate industry that really did put an end to the market-rate 1990s.

      '<p><b>BORN DAVID CORNWELL</b><b> </b>in 1931, John le Carré was too young to go to war and thus too young to experience Britain’s patriotic struggle with Nazi Germany from inside the intelligence service, too young to have worked in alliance with the Soviet Union, and much too young to have been a university student in the 1930s, when many idealistic young Britons joined with the Communists because they were the staunchest opponents of fascism. He was sent to boarding school at the age of five, and it left him with a bitter feeling toward his country’s ruling institutions, even as he would remain thoroughly a creature of them. There was a disconnect between his messy homelife and the orthodox Anglicanism of his schooling. He had a fascination with monks but they couldn’t have been more different from his father Ronnie, a divorcé (le Carré’s mother left him when the boy was five) and a criminal who would soon be exposed in the press as a heavy-duty con man after a bankruptcy that made headlines. “I began to think,” he recalled, “that I was the plaything of ridiculous forces, on the one hand this rackety criminality, on the other hand this toffee-nosed high-school style and I fled it really.” </p>\n<p>Ronnie Cornwell would be the model for Rick Pym, father of the double agent at the center of his son’s 1986 novel <i>A Perfect Spy</i>. “A theme of the novel,” le Carré wrote to his aunt Ella Haymes, who along with her sister Ruby was upset by the book (or at least its reception—they hadn’t read it), “is that hypocrisy thrives upon the silence and the goodheartedness of respectable people, and that deceit, when it passes unchallenged, can be bestowed upon one generation by another.” He enclosed a more “affectionate” portrait by his older brother Tony, an unpublished essay titled “My Brother’s Father and Mine,” in which Ronnie is described as “a picaresque, charming, maddening man.” Ronnie had died a decade earlier. Le Carré paid for the funeral but did not attend it. After the instability and shame of his childhood, he had to endure his father taking credit for his writing talent (Ronnie neither wrote nor was much of a reader), ordering copies of his novels on credit without paying for them, then selling them signed “From the author’s father.” He told an audience in 1997: “I was brought up in a bookless household, and I have a natural sympathy for people who grow up without the example of reading, or come late to it, or never come at all.” It was his stepmother Jean who read to him <i>The Wind in the Willows </i>once when he was sick and bedridden, his earliest literary memory. She would be an affectionate correspondent of her stepson’s until her death, still sending him sweaters for his birthday into his forties. </p>\n<p>When le Carré was sixteen, his father pulled him out of Sherborne School and sent him to Bern University to study German. His housemaster, R. S. Thompson, was sad to lose the sensitive boy who won prizes for his poetry: “He strikes me as the sort who might become either Archbishop of Canterbury or a first rate criminal!” It was another teacher at Sherborne, Frank King, who brought him to German literature. “He spoke excellent German,” le Carré said, “and he always reminded us in German class, as everyone was demonising Germany with justice, that there was another Germany, an enduring one and a much older one and a wise and loveable Germany.” King had also been an officer in the Military Intelligence Service during the war. In Bern, le Carré “assumed German identity and German culture as a replacement of my own. That’s where it began.” Soon he would be recruited to the British Intelligence Corps in Bern. It was membership in that order, along with his poetic sensibilities, that would determine the unlikely course of the rest of his life. </p>\n<p>During this phase, on a holiday in Saint Moritz in 1950, he met Ann Sharp, the daughter of a Royal Air Force officer. His father, she recalled, was using his son “as bait for the daughter of a possible client.” Le Carré would marry Ann in 1954. She is the addressee of many of the early missives collected in <i>A Private Spy: The Letters of John le Carré</i>, edited by their son Tim Cornwell, a journalist who died after finishing work on the volume this past May. Le Carré was an avid skier and his letters to Ann combine details of his injuries on the slopes with sweet and unbridled notes of longing for her, shades of the romantic effusiveness shared by many of the characters he would later create. Here he is in 1951 recovering from a fall on the slopes where he injured his left thigh:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<p>Sorry my writing is a bit groggy, but I have just been given some pills to make me sleep. But I want to talk to you so much, to think of you &amp; imagine I am holding you in my arms, and you are pressing up against me as if you were really a part of me. I want to dream of your deep, soft eyes and of your voice. To think for a second you are here, talking to me. To suppose you are sitting here beside me. </p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<p>It won’t be long now, darling. </p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Few letters record le Carré’s military service and none refer explicitly to his intelligence work as he was doing it, but there is one reference in a letter to Ann to some derring-do he practiced in training in 1950: “Today D. played spies and was caught and put in prison. Escaped in true E. Phillips Oppenheim by laying out an Other Rank guard and removing his braces &amp; tying him up, and stealing his revolver. Masqueraded as a publican from Doncaster. All rather fun, but cut my hand a little in the fight.” Oppenheim was a popular pulp spy novel writer of the early twentieth century; in a public feud over the Kim Philby affair in the late 1960s, Graham Greene, one of le Carré’s early supporters—he provided a crucial blurb for <i>The Spy Who Came in from the Cold</i>: “the best spy story I have ever read”—would disparagingly compare the younger writer to Oppenheim. (Greene and le Carré made up and continued a correspondence of mutual admiration.) Later, stationed in Austria, le Carré writes to Ann of sharing a train compartment with thirty Soviet soldiers also engaged in the ongoing occupation: “We smoked cigarettes together, but they refused to speak to me, or even say ‘Goodbye’ when they got out of the train.” Austria itself in 1951 was “a hot-bed of Communism now, and the up &amp; coming breeding ground for international intrigue of every description.”</p>\n<p>After his year of military service, le Carré went to Oxford, where he continued his studies in German as well as his intelligence work, hanging around leftist circles to report back to MI5. He was a gifted illustrator, and <i>A Private Spy</i> includes a front page of the <i>Oxford Left</i> newspaper’s “Special Peace Issue” with an illustration of his, of crippled refugees in a postapocalyptic landscape, for an editorial advocating nuclear abolition. The paper’s editor Stanley Mitchell was among those he informed on. Around this time Ronnie’s property frauds—the resulting debts in excess of £1,000,000—were exposed in the press. The checks for his son’s university fees were bouncing to boot. Beyond the desperate hustle for money from generous friends that ensued, Ronnie’s crimes were a source of deep shame to his son: “Suffice it to say, that my father has revealed himself both through his police-related and his private affairs to be an infinite, darkest swindler,” he wrote to Kaspar von Almen, a friend from his Bern days. “The clothes I wore, the food I ate and the books I read were bought with the money this had provided. Little old ladies in the Midlands had provided every penny of their savings towards some lunatic scheme which never existed—honest good Bürgers had been <i>legally</i> robbed and ruined, whilst I fattened and grazed on their pastures.” And to the Reverend Vivian Green, a mentor at both Sherborne and Oxford who would marry le Carré and Ann in 1954: “I’ve always wanted to become a Christian, and try &amp; live like one.” </p>\n</p>\n<div class="article-image-container">\n<div class="blog-article__image blog-article__image--portrait">\n        <af-more-images-link :article-id="25148" :image-id="60366" article-title="Cold Snap" :image-names=\'["article"]\'><br />\n                        <img decoding="async" src="//www.bookforum.com/uploads/upload.000/id25148/article00_1064x.jpg" alt="John le Carré and his half-sister Charlotte Cornwell, ca. 1956.

He writes in disgust to Ann Sharp on May 26, 1953, a week before the coronation of Elizabeth II: “There is Coronation beer, Coronation toothpaste and Coronation licensing laws. . . . What a far better investment it is not to sell the Crown Jewels, but to line them for view on a queen’s head, for dollars, francs, pesetas, rupees, marks, obols or what you will. What a pity that a national gift for tradition has become a national opportunity for dishonesty.” The disgust with commerce would be echoed by “bloody” Bill Haydon—a traitor and as such not exactly an authorial stand-in—in <i>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</i>: “He spoke not of the decline of the West, but of its death by greed and constipation.” At the end of the letter to Ann, le Carré says he will be going to London for a cocktail party at the Soviet Embassy, without mentioning that his purpose was to pose as a leftist sympathizer for MI5.</p>\n<p>After Oxford, le Carré took a job teaching German and French at Eton College. “I’m not a bit sure I can stand the Eton pace!” he wrote to Green. “I don’t think I’ve ever met <i>so</i> much arrogance.” Certainly the reputation of Eton’s students (think of Boris Johnson, whom le Carré calls an “Etonian oik” in a late letter) comes through in his correspondence. The boys’ essays “are very clever—clever and crammed with idiotic careless mistakes.” There were new temptations on campus at the time: “there is a curious lowering of standards among the aristocracy e.g. Lord C. Spencer Churchill (aged 16) [descendant of Cornelius Vanderbilt and a son of the tenth duke of Marlborough] tells me that he spends his evenings with father glued to the television.” Even among the intellectual students, there “is an infuriating tradition of not being enthusiastic about anything, or surprised. Hence discussions on painting for instance are somewhat limited by the extent to which a boy will confess himself impressed.” Many believed the withering portrait of a boarding school in his second novel, <i>A Murder of Quality</i>, was based more on Eton than on Sherborne. (The 1991 TV adaptation, with Denholm Elliott and Christian Bale, would be shot at Sherborne.) Yet it wasn’t all bad, or not as bad as the time le Carré had spent at school: “There is astonishing liberalism in many ways—not the least of these being the number of boys who are so terribly bad at games that Sherborne would have had a fit, and whose lives remain unimpaired by this handicap.”</p>\n<p>Le Carré worked full-time in the intelligence service, for MI5 in London and for MI6 in Germany, from 1958 until 1963, when his fame as the author of <i>The Spy Who Came in from the Cold </i>(his third book but the first with significant sales and recognition) made him useless as a spook, even under a pseudonym. (Kim Philby had blown his cover to the Soviets by this time anyway.) The letters from this phase are few and light on detail. The record picks up when he begins correspondence as an author. Not yet famous, he writes to a family friend: “I have decided to cultivate that intense, worried look and to start writing brilliant, untidy letters for future biographers. This is one.” It is amusing to read his letter to Hilary Rubinstein, an editor who worked on his first novel, <i>Call for the Dead</i>, to answer the questions of a lawyer: “The characters <i>are </i>wholly fictitious, and so is the Secret Service setting—so far as I am capable of judging I know of no Government office at or near Cambridge Circus, but I do not suppose the Secret Service publicises the location of its offices. My reading on the subject has always led me to the belief that the Intelligence work is divided between separate services and you will notice that in my book there is only one service, which I suppose reduces the risk of a chance similarity.” How coy! Of course, he knew that MI5 was in Mayfair and MI6 was in Westminster—he had worked for both. Combining the services and moving them to Cambridge Circus put his characters in spitting distance of Soho, the better to allow for random binges at the pub and casual visits by George Smiley to the rare booksellers on Charing Cross Road. All the better to put a bit of space between them and the clubs of St. James’s Square. And the option of referring to the whole operation as the Circus—there in one word was all the intrigue, all the dysfunction, all the fun. </p>\n<p>There is plenty of trivia about the Smiley books and their adaptations in the correspondence. In 1978, le Carré wrote a flattering letter to Alec Guinness, saying that he and producer Jonathan Powell and screenwriter Arthur Hopcraft “agreed on one thing: that if we were to cry for the moon, we would cry for Guinness as Smiley, and build everything else to fit.” The only quality of the character’s he lacked was “plumpness.” (Indeed, on his first appearance Smiley is described as “a shrunken toad” in bad clothes.) “Some actors can act intelligent,” le Carré asserted in a second letter courting the actor. “Others are intelligent and come over dull, because of some mannerism which gets in the way. And a very few are intelligent and convey it: in <i>Tinker Tailor</i> this gift will be pure gold, because it gives such base to the other things—the solitude, the moral concern, the humanity of Smiley—all, because of the intelligence of his perceptions, grow under our eyes and in your care.” For all the flattery of the initial approach, le Carré later said he preferred Gary Oldman’s performance of the role in Tomas Alfredson’s 2011 film. In a 1980 letter to his stepmother, he mentions that Stanley Kubrick wanted to make a film of <i>Smiley’s People</i>, but he turned him down to stick with Guinness and the BBC.</p>\n<p>Beginning with <i>The Honourable Schoolboy</i> (1977), the second installment in the Karla trilogy set largely in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, le Carré’s novels became journalistic enterprises. He would undertake extensive travel and recruit sources, often paying them handsomely for their time. The subjects of his post–Cold War novels were various: big pharma, the war on terror, conflict in the Caucasus, arms smuggling, etc. By the time of the Iraq invasion he was publicly a man of the left. His sons Simon and Stephen formed a production company in 2010 to make adaptations of his work a family business. His first marriage had ended in divorce in 1971 after his affair with Susie Kennaway, the wife of his friend, the Scottish novelist James Kennaway. The episode inspired <i>The Naive and Sentimental Lover</i>, the only le Carré novel that doesn’t qualify as a thriller. In 1972 he married Jane Eustace, who had worked in publishing and introduced him to Bob Gottlieb, his longtime editor at Knopf. The couple lived in London and Cornwall, where they both died within months of each other. Both had been suffering from cancer, though it was pneumonia that felled le Carré in December 2020. </p>\n<p>In a reply to an editor at the <i>Hampstead &amp; Highgate Express </i>who asked him to review Greene’s late novel <i>The Human Factor</i>, le Carré said Greene was “a great writer who has, as he says himself, to put up with longevity.” Time brings the risk of the “off book.” Only after le Carré turned eighty did the novels take on an uncharacteristic slightness. He was writing till the end. After <i>Agent Running in the Field</i> (2019), a novel with parallels to the Edward Snowden affair, he started a book with the working title <i>The George Smiley Years</i>, which included an encounter between Smiley and his arch-nemesis and foil Karla, after the Russian spy chief’s defection to the West. Smiley was last seen in <i>A Legacy of Spies</i> (2017), in which the children of characters from <i>The Spy Who Came in from the Cold </i>and <i>Tinker Tailor</i> make inquiries about what happened to their parents. Smiley shows up at the end, reading German literature and pleased that the divided Europe of his spy years has now achieved a peaceful union. Le Carré was aghast at Brexit and sought Irish citizenship (Ronnie Cornwell’s mother Bessie was Irish). The sight of another hot war on the European frontier would have crushed him. Responding to a Soviet reviewer who called him an “apologist” for the Cold War, le Carré insisted that his view was the opposite and was in fact “the greatest heresy”: “there is no victory and no virtue in the Cold War, only a condition of human illness and political misery.” A critic looking for simple binaries would be better off reading novels about “the hyena who stalks the capitalist deserts,” James Bond, a character with “the one piece of equipment without which not even his formula would work: an entirely evil enemy.” </p>\n<p><a href="https://www.bookforum.com/contributor/christian-lorentzen" title="Contributions by Christian Lorentzen">Christian Lorentzen</a> is a writer living in Brooklyn.</p>\n',

      '<p>Kurt Vonnegut’s<i> Galápagos </i>is fundamentally about the human species and the promises and perils of human nature. Although Vonnegut published <i>Galápagos </i>fifteen years before scientists Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer first proposed the idea of naming our current geological epoch the Anthropocene, the novel’s environmental parables become even more relevant as we experience the effects of humans acting as geological agents on the planet. </p>\n<p><i>Galápagos </i>is able to tackle these topics successfully because it is grounded in science. The novel simultaneously employs Darwin’s theories of natural selection with scientific integrity while critiquing social Darwinism. Vonnegut’s 1982 trip to the Galápagos Islands, careful study of Darwin’s writings, and additional research on evolution, in fact, earned him praise from renowned evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould, who thought the novel was “a wonderful <i>roman à clef </i>about evolutionary theory” and study of “how random the selection is.” Despite its elements of plausibility, the novel does not attempt to imagine the possible evolutionary paths of multiple species in different parts of the globe. Instead, Vonnegut returns to the site of Darwin’s inspiration to explore the fate of the species most profoundly altering the surface of the planet: <i>Homo sapiens</i>. As we peer one million years into the future, we discover a dramatically altered, benign form of humankind, evolved from a tiny band of colonists on the fictional island of Santa Rosalia. The “whole rest of the animal world,” by contrast, “has done strikingly little to improve its survival tactics in all that time,” leaving little doubt that it’s our species that needs to contemplate its planetary role.</p>\n<p>For Vonnegut, the enormous stretch of time and narrative perspective of the novel presented a far greater challenge than envisioning possible evolutionary paths. After all, how can anatomically modern <i>Homo sapiens </i>think within a million-year time frame when we’ve only existed as a species for about 200,000 years and can only point to approximately 5,500 years of recorded history? Or, to borrow the language of journalist Alan Weisman’s famous title, how do we imagine “the world without us”? As historian Dipesh Chakrabarty points out, “we have to insert ourselves into a future ‘without us’ in order to be able to visualize it.” Vonnegut brilliantly solves these problems by creating the ghostly narrator Leon Trout, who can draw on his former human experiences to interpret human and planetary conditions, but who also possesses an omniscient narrative capacity due to his phantom wanderings. Like the residents of Vicuna, Leon Trout can slip into the bodies of humans to explore their thoughts, emotions, and histories. And because his curiosity about the fate of the Santa Rosalia colonists prevents him from crossing over into the “blue tunnel to the afterlife,” his one-million-year sentence to wander the Earth allows for the appropriate “deep time” framework. The biological offspring of Kilgore Trout and his far more optimistic mother, Leon can also see the best and worst in humanity and raise important questions about our species.</p>\n<p>As a Vietnam veteran and son of Kilgore Trout, Leon is especially well equipped to see the dark side of humanity and the particular environmental problems human beings are causing in November 1986, the pivotal time frame when a series of “lucky” accidents gathers the ten future colonists and send them on their way to Santa Rosalia. Vonnegut assigns both particular and species-level blame for these widespread ecological woes. Embodying the worst of these behaviors is Andrew MacIntosh, a fifty-five-year-old “American financier and adventurer of great inherited wealth.” We learn, for example, of MacIntosh’s “mania for claiming as his own property as many of the planet’s life-support systems as possible” and of the fact that he “found ensuring the survival of the human race a total bore.” MacIntosh’s environmental crimes are rendered more sinister as we watch him masquerade as “an ardent conservationist” while his companies act as “notorious damagers of the water or the soil or the atmosphere.” Vonnegut underscores the huge economic disparities between MacIntosh, the urban poor, and Indigenous rain forest tribes of Ecuador, but he ultimately emphasizes the broader anthropocentric devastation of Earth.</p>\n<p>Leon sets up these collective impacts early in the novel, noting that the worldwide financial crisis in 1986 A.D. “was simply the latest in a series of murderous twentieth-century catastrophes which had originated entirely in human brains.” With the broader vision afforded by expanses of time and space, Leon carefully mentions <i>human </i>causes for the famines, wars, and environmental damage “to all other living things”—not a scarcity of natural resources. By attributing this damage to people’s “oversize brains,” he goes beyond the economic policies, national conflicts, and greed immediately underlying the problems, to address one of the most distinctive features of our species. This vision of our big-brained species destroying “the earthling part of the clockwork of the universe” aligns with what biologist E. O. Wilson bemoaned for decades: “Humanity has so far played the role of planetary killer, concerned only with its own short-term survival.” As Vonnegut learned in his physical anthropology classes, it was indeed our large brains, along with our bipedalism and dexterous hands, which helped our hominid ancestors develop tools and alter their environments.</p>\n<p>True to his career-long pacifism, Vonnegut uses Leon’s war experiences as a filter to underscore the ecological damage done by weapons. <i>Galápagos </i>is littered with descriptions of destructive twentieth-century military technologies, which, Leon notes, can rival even the mechanisms of evolution. After explaining the origins of new explosives used in the fictional Peruvian-Ecuadoran conflict of November 1986, Leon concludes, “And the Law of Natural Selection was powerless to respond to such new technologies. No female of any species, unless, maybe, she was a rhinoceros, could expect to give birth to a baby who was fireproof, bombproof, or bulletproof.” To heighten the bite of this observation, Leon mentions that “the best that the Law of Natural Selection could come up with” was people who weren’t “afraid of anything, even though there was so much to fear”—people like Andrew MacIntosh.</p>\n<p>Despite all the planetary dangers posed by humans and their large brains, <i>Galápagos </i>suggests that although we have become geological agents capable of altering the planet on a large scale, human beings are still governed by the same natural laws and life-supporting systems that affect <i>all </i>species. Ultimately, it’s not a human-caused catastrophe that wipes out everyone except for the ten Santa Rosalia colonists. It’s a microscopic bacterium that destroys human ova in women’s ovaries. This “new creature” emerges at the Frankfurt Book Fair and spreads around the globe, reaching every human population but the isolated Santa Rosalia colonists. Comparing the near total extinction of humans to that of “mighty land tortoises,” Leon again uses his macro views of time and space to place the pandemic within the broad history of many David-Goliath stories. Leon’s dry sense of humor and lack of details about the pandemic minimize the brutal realities of human extinction outside of Santa Rosalia. The biological stakes of Vonnegut’s literary experiment, nevertheless, are all too real. As environmental historian Dan Flores reminds us, if we refuse to recognize the “selfishness and short-sightedness” apparently “built into our very evolution” and “stop the steady destruction of the world . . . then externally delivered checks are what we can expect.” The Law of Natural Selection, Leon points out, can easily repair the planet’s “clockwork,” bringing “humanity into harmony with itself and the rest of Nature.”</p>\n<p>In <i>Galápagos </i>that “harmony” comes at the expense of losing virtually all the traits that make <i>Homo sapiens </i>“human.” In the year 1,001,986 A.D., the descendants of the Santa Rosalia colonists have evolved into amphibious “fisher folk” with a silky, seal-like pelt, arm flippers, streamlined skulls, and much smaller brains. With adaptations in keeping with the rich marine life surrounding the isolated volcanic islands, these future hominids spend much of their thirty-year life span catching fish or simply frolicking like sea lions on shore. The shorter life span has reduced childhood to nine months, and “people” identify each other by their distinctive odors, since their sense of smell has been dramatically increased. Although Leon contemplates possible evolutionary paths had the Santa Rosalia colonists been composed of the wealthy celebrities originally scheduled for the <i>Bahía de Darwin</i>’s maiden voyage, he concludes that the outcome still would have been the same: “In the long run, the survivors would still have been not the most ferocious struggler but the most efficient fisherfolk. That’s how things work in the islands here.”</p>\n<p>Because the novel is fundamentally about modern <i>Homo sapiens </i>and our dangers to ourselves and the planet, Vonnegut offers comparatively little narrative space to our species’ successors. Rather than provide any detailed portraits of them, Vonnegut instead has his ghostly narrator reveal individual characteristics of these new hominids one at a time over the course of the novel. In another experiment with time, the narrative symbolically simulates evolution on the very human-centered time scale it takes for the reader to finish the novel. The future “fisherfolk” come into focus trait by trait as Leon’s tale first sweeps back to 1986 A.D. and then returns to the “present” of a million years beyond that. While this technique forces readers to contemplate the deep time of evolution and geology, Vonnegut’s primary purpose is to explore the ways natural selection has put destructive human characteristics in check. As Leon reminds us at the start of his story, “this was a very innocent planet, except for those great big brains.”</p>\n<p><i><b>Excerpted from </b></i><b>Lucky Mud &amp; Other Foma: A Field Guide to Kurt Vonnegut&#8217;s Environmentalism and Planetary Citizenship</b><i><b>.

      '<p><b>ANGELO HERNANDEZ-SIAS: A funny story about the title story of <i>Liberation Day</i> (Random House, $28) is that you woke up one night from a dream and wrote something on your notepad, thinking it was the most brilliant idea. And when you woke up, you found it said: “Custer in the Bardo.”</b></p>\n<p><b>GEORGE SAUNDERS</b>: In the dream state, it was so perfect, it seemed like a big advance over <i>Lincoln in the Bardo</i>. Luckily, in the light of day, I thought better of it. I had been wanting to write about Custer for a long time, but after that dream and the horror of reading that title in the morning, I just gave up on it. And then, about halfway through writing what became “Liberation Day,” this kind of sci-fi story, I needed some sort of shtick—a vignette for the character to narrate. And I thought, Oh, what the hell? I know a lot about Custer, so let’s just drop it in there and see if the rest of the story forms around it. I talk about this a lot in my workshop classes—writing has just got to be fun. And if it’s not fun, it won’t ever mean anything. If we’re having fun, there’s a greater chance that we’ll write ourselves out of our plan, into something new—new and even confusing. This is a good thing.</p>\n<p>Sometimes plot is just recognizing your own discontent as a writer at a certain point in a story. Saying, “Gosh, this story isn’t holding together,” or “This story is feeling boring to me,” or “This question is stopping me from moving ahead.” If you just let the story turn to that discontent, that’s what we call plot. It’s the story responding to the story.</p>\n<p><b>And as the reader it’s satisfying to see that boredom mirrored, or that question addressed.</b></p>\n<p>Right, it’s like I’m going through a doorway and the reader’s coming through a second later. The writer has a certain experience, and the reader, theoretically following pretty closely behind the writer, has a simulation of the same experience.</p>\n<p><b>You say you’ve had a long-standing interest in Custer. Does that interest extend to history more generally?</b></p>\n<p>Yes, nineteenth-century history is really alive for me. It might just be that I’m a reincarnated dead infantryman. But also, it’s a time far enough back that nobody really knows how things were. We don’t know how houses smelled or how people actually spoke or what their mind cloud would have felt like to them. So that gives the writer a lot of leeway. At the same time, we can sort of picture Custer, we can picture Gettysburg. Also, when I was here at Syracuse nine million years ago, this professor used to call me Custer. I had a big mullet. I was kind of out of my league and I just loved that he even noticed me. So, I read that Evan S. Connell book, <i>Son of the Morning Star</i>. There was just something so epic about that battle, so tragic—quick death in the summer heat.</p>\n<p><b>What prevents you from writing an actual history? I would guess that part of your answer will be that there’s more obligation to—actually, no, let me not assume your answer.</b></p>\n<p>You’re right about that, there’s a lot more obligation to what actually happened, or in this case what may have actually happened, since nobody really knows. That obligation kind of negates the thin little gift that I have, which has more to do with invention, I guess. I could be a moderately OK historian, but why? It’s like that Flannery O’Connor quote: “The writer can choose what he writes about but he cannot choose what he is able to make live.”</p>\n<p><b>You’ve talked about how oftentimes when you’re working with a realist conceit, the interior monologue goes haywire. But there are stories in this collection, like “Sparrow” and “A Thing at Work,” that seem to be realist through and through. What’s your approach like then?</b></p>\n<p>In order to get the language to pop, I have a few different ways I can go. There’s the “Liberation Day” approach, where there are no limits. And then there’s a story like “Mother’s Day,” where you’ve got intense inner monologues that you can have a lot of fun with. And when I got to “Sparrow,” I could tell there weren’t going to be any internal monologues, and it’s not really sci-fi. Around that time, I had read some Gertrude Stein. And that is like, <i>strong medicine</i>. She had this way of boring down on a thought by shaped repetitions, and I found myself doing something like that. “Sparrow” started when I woke from a dream and just wrote down the first five or six lines, which, to me, felt sort of like Stein. I felt myself asking, How can I describe these ostensibly realistic events in a more interesting language?</p>\n<p><b>“Sparrow” is a love story about two characters named Randy and Gloria, who work together. Gloria is presented as a completely unremarkable person and Randy is an egoist. You write, “He liked the way she noticed and enjoyed the way he tended to get most things right.”</b></p>\n<p>He’s a dude. Definitely.</p>\n<p><b>Where do you think the humor of this story comes from?</b></p>\n<p>Well, for that part you mention above, we’re in Randy’s head. And he’s trying to earnestly describe what’s going on as he develops this crush. But in the process, he’s sort of showing his ass because he’s thinking, you know, I really like her because she agrees with me, and since she agrees with me, she’s very bright! At first, I was just trying to be funny. But then I found something else going on. Gloria is, at least according to this story, a really dull, flawed, unlovable woman, who falls in love with the guy who the story tells us is an egotistical guy. We’ve got a love story between two people whom we’ve been told, one, we shouldn’t like, and two, won’t like each other. But they do anyway. And isn’t that kind of every relationship? Two odd people, finding comfort in one another? So part of the trajectory of that story was me thinking, Hey, I’m actually not making fun of anybody. I’m describing a great love affair, maybe!</p>\n</p>\n<div class="article-image-container">\n<div class="blog-article__image blog-article__image--portrait">\n        <af-more-images-link :article-id="25158" :image-id="60418" article-title="A Case for the Weird Voice" :image-names=\'["article"]\'><br />\n                        <img decoding="async" src="//www.bookforum.com/uploads/upload.000/id25158/article00_large.jpg" alt="George Saunders, 2018.

In “Elliott Spencer,” the main character has been inducted into a cause that he’s not fully aware of, and he’s basically been programmed to say a few keywords. Like Jeremy of “Liberation Day,” he has no memory of his previous existence. When you think of a sci-fi conceit, what draws you back to language itself?</b></p>\n<p>Usually, it starts with the language. Before there’s any conceit, I’ll have a page or two of some language that I’ve either accidentally arrived at or that has come from a little thought experiment.</p>\n<p>One of my early misunderstandings of Buddhism was that you’re trying to have zero thoughts. That’s not actually true, but it got me to wonder what it would be like if you eliminated all thought—if you took all the data out and left the operating system intact. How would a mind refill with language? So, with “Elliott Spencer” I was goofing around with that idea and stumbled on a tone I liked. And then my mind was just going, All right, so who is that talking? And how did he get in that state? And again, that’s another way of generating plot. If I do a weird voice, the reader’s natural question is, Why is this guy talking so weird? And you have to discover the answer as you’re doing it. You make the funny voice first, and then the rest will take care of itself. That’s essentially what we call “world-building”—making a case for the weird voice.</p>\n<p><b>You recently wrote an introduction to <i>Dubliners</i>, and noted how the arc of the collection bends towards disillusionment. What’s the arc of <i>Liberation Day</i>?</b></p>\n<p>Yeah, I think Joyce himself said that the collection progresses from childhood to youth to adulthood to public life. And the trajectory, in my interpretation, is one of increasing compromise and burden. In each of the stories in <i>Liberation Day</i>, someone starts out deluded and confused and misled, then sheds that delusion and moves in the direction of truth, with different results. But this pattern doesn’t interest me abstractly—I just found myself arriving there. When I’m writing a story, I’m just trying to be lively for nine pages, and then refine that liveliness so the story corners more sharply. What’s interesting is that the subconscious still brings you somewhere.</p>\n<p><b>I’m glad you bring up the subconscious—I was hoping to ask about its role in your process.</b></p>\n<p>I feel like the handmaiden of the subconscious. I’m just there to receive whatever it feels like sending. I don’t really know how it works, but I know it’s real—that “craft” is an individual writer figuring out a way to get clear access to her subconscious mind. I trust in that process more and more as I get older. I know that my way of opening that portal is revising by taste, on a very micro level, over and over. The thrilling thing is being in the presence of something smarter than yourself, something you can access by mundane technical means.</p>\n<p><b>Have you ever abandoned a story?</b></p>\n<p>I always say I never do that, but I did recently. There was one story in the manuscript, called “Appeasement, Ohio.” It was a very political story about a working-class family with a right-winger son who is part of a group that claims the American Civil War never happened, that it was a liberal plot. It’s pretty funny and has some good moments, but everyone I showed it to was like, “Nope.” It could be that I go back to it and at least find something to pull out of it, or it’ll make more sense as to why it wasn’t working.</p>\n<p><b>Yeah, maybe it’ll be in your next collection. It’s fascinating to hear about the mess and chaos and persistence that the work requires.</b></p>\n<p>Yes. It’s interesting that as you get older, as a writer, you have to keep trying to find new ways to mystify yourself. New approaches, new forms. And in this way, writing is a real lifelong gift. It would be scary to come to the end of feeling the mystery in life, and art is a way of infusing your days with a relation to mystery. And it’s lovely to feel that the problems of life are still speaking to you, through your form.</p>\n<p><b>And it sounds like there might even be a kind of inevitability to how these questions arise for you. You’re playing with the raw materials of language, and then before you know it, the structure that you’ve built is asking some philosophical question.</b></p>\n<p>That’s a beautiful way to put it.</p>\n<p><b>It’s a reassuring thought, that the work will take care of itself.</b></p>\n<p>Your mind will create the problems and create the solutions and then that process will create a whole second set of problems that you can then move into.</p>\n</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.bookforum.com/contributor/angelo-hernandez-sias" title="Contributions by Angelo Hernandez-Sias">Angelo Hernandez-Sias</a> is an MFA candidate in fiction at Syracuse University.

The poor, the young, the nonwhite, the queer, the marginal were its constituents, and they made full use of public spaces in which they would otherwise be surveilled and policed. They made art on the plywood masks worn by fancy boutiques, rode their bikes in great swarms down the carless thoroughfares, staged dances and boxing matches and every kind of performance in the parks. Moss vividly conveys the exhilaration, using his gifts as a writer, an observer of the city, a moral philosopher, and a font of empathy. He also covers the return of the repressors, and the mood plummets. A few years earlier I’d read every memoir of the Paris Commune that I could find; the two sets of events followed the same emotional arc. The summer of 2020 in NYC may have been less world-historical than the Commune, but it represented the same human urge and will for liberation. —LUCY SANTE</p>\n<p>I HAVE NEVER ascribed to a negative theology of art—that its beauty and its truth are ineffable, ungraspable, and that the ideal reader has no choice but to fall silent before it. Jon Fosse’s <b>SEPTOLOGY</b> is the only work of fiction I have read that has troubled my unbelief. Its seven volumes tell of a painter named Asle, and of his friend, also a painter named Asle, their minds and memories running together in the dark days that lead up to Christmas. But to describe what <i>Septology </i>is about—or even to claim that it is about something that can be fixed in words—is already to defile it. Perhaps it would be simpler to say that reading it is the closest I have come to feeling the presence of God here on earth. —MERVE EMRE</p>\n<p>THE BOOK <b>POND</b> is new, beautiful writing, and it plumbs the English language, its possibilities commonly underused, with lush vocabulary. Claire-Louise Bennett’s fiction, her protagonist’s thoughts and actions, is grounded in vegetable gardens, in love and loss, and in a winning imagination. A pleasure to read.</p>\n<p>Rachel Aviv’s <b>STRANGERS TO OURSELVES: UNSETTLED MINDS AND THE STORIES THAT MAKE US</b> is an important contribution to contemporary thought about mental illness and the psychiatrization of everyday life. Through the stories, case histories, of others, Aviv examines how they came to be identified by their “illnesses,” and how their illnesses told their stories and not them. The book asks readers to be skeptical of professional “mind-readers” and diagnoses that threaten to control a person’s life. —LYNNE TILLMAN</p>\n<p>I TAUGHT Noor Naga’s debut novel <b>IF AN EGYPTIAN CANNOT SPEAK ENGLISH</b> in my postcolonial literature class this semester. One student wrote in her book report: “My first two thoughts after concluding the book were (1) <i>wow that was really good</i> and (2) <i>wow I am not smart enough to be discussing this book</i>.” A young New Yorker of Egyptian origin lands in Cairo. She thinks “this is a real place where real things happen. Not microaggressions that are tweeted about, not theory.” A part of the new reality she encounters, adult and aggressive, is a young man from a village called Shobrakheit who had worked as a photographer during the revolution that overthrew Mubarak. He is struggling with a drug habit and also with the low that has followed that political high. I loved the novel because everything you learned about in college classes on Edward Said’s <i>Orientalism</i> is here put into play in people’s lives. And then, in the book’s concluding section, the story that we have just read is discussed in a writing workshop with its species of deranged wokeness. More mocking and meaningful than the dull MFA vs. NYC debate, this section by itself is worth the price of admission.</p>\n<p>If all that I have said above is about the subtle transformation of knowledge into art, then another favorite book of mine from 2022 is the memoir <b>STAY TRUE</b> by Hua Hsu. Debates on Asian American identity, music, and culture are unpacked in a language so limpid and pure that thought becomes pure feeling. —AMITAVA KUMAR</p>\n<p>I’VE BEEN ASKED to read pretty much every book on work that has come out in the last few years, and many of them are very good. But for this end-of-year wrap-up I’ve chosen a book that is not about work, except in the way that it is a book about capitalism; and, as Brett Scott writes, the true lifeblood of that system is not money but people carrying out labor.</p>\n<p>Scott’s <b>CLOUDMONEY: CASH, CARDS, CRYPTO, AND THE WAR FOR OUR WALLETS</b> is indeed a book about money: what it is, what it isn’t, and why it matters for everyone to know the difference. It is also a book about power, and how that power is being wielded by a tech-finance nexus that pretends its takeover is natural, unavoidable, simply a consequence of something like evolution. “Many mainstream futurists get paid a lot of money to style themselves as prophets ofinevitabilities,” Scott writes, but he is arguing that we can change this situation, and, in fact, that we must. That we should see in a “cashless” society an enclosure by the biggest firms of late capitalism—by Wall Street and Silicon Valley—of everything we do, a way to produce more data, which is, of course, the unit of value of a digitized world.</p>\n<p>Scott’s perspective is global and his argument, at the end of the day, a little bit romantic. Yet we need, I think, more romance and dare I say more friction in a world pushing us closer to the metaverse of Mark Zuckerberg’s dreams. It is what allows a book about money and technology to become something beautiful. —SARAH JAFFE</p>\n<p>I’VE NEVER READ a book like Ryan Lee Wong’s delightfully laid-back debut, <b>WHICH SIDE ARE YOU ON</b>, which attempts to think through one of the great questions of our times: How do we balance our political convictions with the need to sometimes just chill out and live? A killjoy might have populated a novel like this, set during the movement for Black lives and—one of Wong’s chief concerns—the rise of a reactionary Asian American conservatism, with us-and-them archetypes. But <i>Which Side Are You On</i> is playful and cranky, a series of conversations between friends and family that help bring these broader struggles into manageable focus. The political is made personal again; discourse is dismissed but values find renewed energy. Wong follows an idealistic, polemical, occasionally lazy college kid contemplating leaving school in order to pursue greater political aims. He is a member of the radical vanguard; he is alone. It spoils nothing to reveal what he learns while driving around Los Angeles with his (much cooler) mother or smoking pot in the hills with his friends: he is neither. —HUA HSU</p>\n<p><b>MY FATHER’S DIET</b> by Adrian Nathan West was the funniest, bleakest book I read this year, the best thing yet written on the undertheorized (but all too real!) relationship between sad divorced dads and their intellectual adult sons. West builds something beautifully grim from the wreckage of American self-help culture; in his portrait of the titular father, he’s crafted a figure of grandly inarticulate pathos. (“It’s a goddamn fountain. I just got it at Walmart. I thought it would help set the mood in the mindfulness room.”) This year, West also translated two amazing books by Hermann Burger, a Bernhard-obsessed, Ferrari-driving sometime-magician who killed himself shortly after completing BRENNER, a discursive, Proustian meditation mostly concerned with the manufacture and smoking of cigars. Burger’s ludicrous self-regard gives even his grimmest work (that would be <b>TRACTATUS LOGICO-SUICIDALIS: ON KILLING ONESELF</b>) a comic edge. It would be a disservice to call a self-described “mortologist” life-affirming, but as in West’s own novel, there’s something exhilarating about seeing despair turned into moving, desperate art. —ANDREW MARTIN</p>\n<p>I DON’T THINK we live in a time <i>of </i>power couples, but maybe we live in one uniquely poised to appreciate power couples. I don’t even mean people who are in love—often, a power couple is made up of two figures who hate each other, or are at least competitive. I mean two charged and stormy souls creating a strange and special life together, one that bubbles over and calls to everyone around them. Mark Rozzo’s <b>EVERYBODY THOUGHT WE WERE CRAZY</b> chronicles one such pairing: the wasp Hollywood princess Brooke Hayward and her onetime husband, unhinged (and unemployable) Dennis Hopper, who casually lorded over a mid-’60s microcosm where Pop art, psychedelic rock, and middling television acting converged. What’s interesting about the Hayward-Hoppers—like their obvious predecessors, Sara and Gerald Murphy—is that despite the chaos around them, they created an oddball domestic bliss, primarily through a spectacular house whose charms went beyond its wackadoo decorating style. Even when Hopper was disappearing for days on end on binges, or Hayward was grappling with giving up her acting career, they provided a foundation for counterculture, however short-lived. The house that Rozzo describes, and which mishmashed Tiffany lamps with Warhols and Hayward’s own tilework, speaks to the idea that a fantastic house goes beyond interior design and good parties to the very spirit of its inventors. —RACHEL TASHJIAN</p>\n<p>LAST MONTH, Sandrine Rousseau, a Green MP in the French National Assembly, made headlines when she declared that French workers have “a right to idleness.” Whether consciously or not, Rousseau was quoting Paul Lafargue, Karl Marx’s wayward son-in-law, who, while in prison in 1880, put the finishing touches on a socialist pamphlet entitled <i>The Right to Be Lazy</i>. Lafargue’s treatise, reissued this year by New York Review Books as <b>THE RIGHT TO BE LAZY: AND OTHER WRITINGS</b> (translated by Alex Andriesse), is a spirited case for idleness as the condition to which humanity should aspire.</p>\n<p>The French proletariat, Lafargue argues mischievously, had succumbed to a “strange madness”: “the love of work.” Their frenzy for labor was so intense that it was harming the idle rich, who had to strain their bellies to consume all that the workers produced. The solution, he proposes, is to “proclaim the Rights of Laziness”—namely by passing a law limiting the workday to three hours. After all, work is slavish, idleness godlike. Consider the deity of the Old Testament: “after six days of work, he rested for eternity.”</p>\n<p>Discontent with the work system has, in the last year, become harder to ignore. The “lying flat” movement in China and a resurgent anti-work movement in the United States reflect the need to redesign our labor arrangements and grant space in contemporary life for soul-enlarging idleness. Lafargue’s riotous attack on the work ethic is, truly, a book for our moment. —CHARLIE TYSON</p>\n<p>THAT WE’RE LIVING in a time in which sexual expression is simultaneously extolled as a political triumph and intensely circumscribed along “better” ethical boundaries than the last ones, and the ones before that, means that sex, in its various cultural manifestations, can often feel boring. Predictable. Played out. The French-speaking world—its veneration of bona fide sexual creeps like Woody Allen and Gabriel Matzneff—hardly represents an ideal, but this year two (three?) of its novels have helped me put things in perspective. First, there’s <b>CHÉRI AND THE END OF CHÉRI</b>, written in the 1920s by that grande dame of French literature, Colette. Few words bear repeating about a writer so exhaustively written about, yet I can’t help but relish and recommend this incestuous love story, so deeply uninterested in the sort of frugality and anxious, political self-scrutiny that characterizes much of the previous decade’s early-feminist literature—as well as much of today’s. Steeped in the hedonism of the noble class, it embraces the splendor of beauty, the excitement of vulgarity, the exquisite brutality of unfettered emotions, parsing through the inner lives of the aging Léa and her lover Chéri with a naked prose not unlike the autofiction of the past years. Then there’s <b>GENTLEMAN CALLERS</b> by the Belgian writer Corinne Hoex, newly translated by Caitlin O’Neil. It takes seriously the realm of fantasy—not just as a space of discovery, where great perils might be safely explored, but as a structuring principle. The slim novel contains a series of dreams, with each “chapter” evocatively detailing the narrator’s erotic encounters with different men—the schoolteacher, the cook, the hunter—with each one bringing the narrator and her textures closer into view. For Hoex, sex is generative—in the metaphorical sense, of course. —BEATRICE LOAYZA</p>\n<p>ADA CALHOUN’S <b>ALSO A POET: FRANK O’HARA, MY FATHER, AND ME</b> seems almost to court disaster. It’s a memoir of a defective parent, the poet and art critic Peter Schjeldahl—who died in October, aged eighty—and a portrait of not just one halcyon era but two, that of the poet and art curator Frank O’Hara (1926–1966), and of the next generation of New York bohemians, among them Schjeldahl, who tried to write O’Hara’s biography in the mid-1970s. Yet Calhoun avoids self-pity and nostalgia to produce something trenchant and controlled, a work of quiet, or sly, virtuosity. The audio version, read by the author, offers a rare bonus—excerpts from the interviews conducted for the abortive book that provided the spur for this wonderfully accomplished one. —LEO ROBSON</p>\n<p>A CHANCE MENTION in the <i>TLS</i> this past summer led me to pick up Elizabeth Jane Howard’s utterly remarkable <b>CAZALET CHRONICLES</b>. One could call this quintet of novels about three generations of a family living in Sussex at the beginning of WWII “enchanting” except for the fact that the word doesn’t quite capture their psychological depth or human wisdom.</p>\n<p>Aside from the <i>Chronicles</i>, Howard, who died at the age of ninety in 2014, wrote a clutch of novels and an excellent autobiography, <i>Slipstream</i>. She was re-nowned for her beauty and always on the lookout for love, as a consequence of which she fell into the arms of many questionable men. Her third husband was the resolutely alcoholic Kingsley Amis, whom she eventually divorced and whose son, Martin, credits Howard in his autobiography <i>Experience</i> with salvaging him from his layabout ways and making him into a reader and conscientious student.</p>\n<p>The <i>Chronicles</i> were best-sellers when they were published in the 1990s (the fifth volume was published in 2013) and were adapted for a BBC television series. The historical arc they draw is large, but the novels are singular for the quality of intimacy they create, in part via the superb dialogue, around the many characters who appear in their pages, from housemaids to great-aunts to the gaggle of children, all of whom live under one roof at Home Place. Three brothers—Hugh, Edward, and Rupert—share in the patriarchal duties; one of them is faithless, another one has lost a hand in WWI, while the third goes missing in combat. The conflicts of the young female cousins—Polly, Louise, and Clary—are especially vivid, rendered with subtlety and humor.</p>\n<p>Full disclosure: I am midway through the <i>Chronicles</i> as I write, taking my time the better to savor the muchness of them. Martin Amis called his stepmother, along with Iris Murdoch, “the most interesting woman writer of her generation.” Why this saga hasn’t been given its due on these shores is a mystery to me. —DAPHNE MERKIN</p>\n',

      '<p><b>SHIRLEY HAZZARD WAS BORN</b> in Sydney, Australia, in 1931. She was the second daughter of Reg and Kit, who met while working in the office of the engineering company that built the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Theirs was a marriage marked, as Brigitta Olubas puts it in <i>Shirley Hazzard: A Writing Life</i>, by an “almost lifelong incompatibility” made more difficult by Reg’s alcoholism and Kit’s bipolarity. Shirley was Kit’s favorite. When she was six or seven years old, Kit asked her to come to the kitchen so they could together put their heads into the gas oven. Shirley later said that the character Dora in <i>The Transit of Venus </i>(1980) was “a very mild dose of my mother—a destroyer who sees herself as a perpetual victim.” </p>\n<p>Reg and Kit wanted to give their girls a better childhood than either of them had enjoyed, and in this they may have succeeded. (Both, Olubas notes, “began their lives in circumstances of illegitimacy and considerable material deprivation.”) Shirley loved the light on the sea as well as Wordsworth, Browning, Auden, Byron, and Baudelaire. She had, if not a photographic memory, then an unusual facility for remembering poems, even though there were times that she “could hardly read the lines for excitement, ecstasy.” During World War II Shirley and her sister Valerie wrote romances about wounded soldiers on the typewriter. When the war ended, Reg, who had been working in the Department of Munitions, was appointed Australian trade commissioner for Hong Kong. The family moved in 1947, and through her parents’ colonial connections Shirley found a job in a British interservices intelligence unit whose duties included monitoring the civil war in mainland China. (Valerie worked at an English-language newspaper.) Olubas brushes away any fancies about Shirley having been a spy, though “there was nonetheless some aspect of rudimentary intelligence gathering involved.” At the office she met and had a chaste affair with Alec Vedeniapine, a White Russian fifteen years her senior. When Valerie became very ill with tuberculosis, the family returned to Australia. “This was the end of life for me,” Shirley later recalled. She wanted to attend university, but it was still uncommon for women to do so, and moreover she hadn’t finished high school. She attended secretarial college instead. “Misery, foreboding, a life sentence,” she wrote, fifty years later. “In this cruel time I wanted to die.”</p>\n<p>Valerie recovered, and for Reg’s next post the family moved to Wellington, New Zealand (“just was as dull as it could possibly be”). Shirley and Vedeniapine corresponded in secret and became engaged. But after she repeatedly delayed plans to see him, Vedeniapine broke it off, writing that he was worried that the life he had chosen, as a farmer in England, would not make her happy. Retrospectively, Hazzard became attached to the theory that her mother had ruined the engagement, a story Olubas politely glosses as “not really supported by evidence.” Decades later Hazzard was still describing Vedeniapine as having an “incapacity . . . for imaginative love,” and she never could believe that he had really wanted to be a farmer. Once, when he was nearing retirement and preparing to sell some beloved cows, Shirley came for a visit. At night she wrote diary entries castigating “those who bind themselves to limitations.” “The farm was not Shirley’s natural habitat,” Vedeniapine’s wife said.</p>\n<p>In late 1951 the Hazzards moved to the United States for Reg’s new job as Australian trade commissioner in New York. From then on, Shirley would return to the country of her birth only a handful of times. (When she became famous, being an “Australian writer” would be a source of uneasiness.) She applied for and got a job at the United Nations in the office of the Technical Assistance Administration, where her responsibilities included recording minutes, typing, and filing. It was boring work (later it became material for the linked stories in <i>People in Glass Houses</i>) and she was again caught up in office romances. Some objects of her affection were unrequited, and the relationships she did have were often secret. As Olubas writes, “The men with whom she was involved through these years were significantly older, and most were married.” Reg went off with another woman in 1953, leaving Kit in precarious circumstances. After Valerie got married and moved back to Australia, Shirley was responsible for supporting her mother, a fact that may explain her lifelong antipathy for Valerie. Over time the rift between the sisters grew, until Shirley could claim, implausibly, that the years of silence on both their parts did not constitute an “estrangement” but was rather “merely boredom.”</p>\n<p>In 1956 Shirley requested and was granted a transfer to Naples, to work in the United Nations Emergency Force office. Her duties were, again, mostly typing, and she did not enjoy the company of her colleagues. At the end of her term she did some traveling in Italy, including a stay at the Villa Solaia, a farmhouse an hour’s walk from Siena where the Vivante family took in paying guests. In the Vivantes Shirley found a surrogate family of intellectuals well connected in Italian literary and anti-fascist circles, as well as new friendships with visitors like Dwight Macdonald, who also stayed at the Villa. She would return to Solaia for two months every summer for the next five years. She was in the kitchen there when she received her first acceptance from the<i> New Yorker</i>, for the short story “Harold.” (Olubas notes that, contrary to the impression Hazzard sometimes gave, “Harold” was neither the first story that she ever wrote nor was it the first she submitted to the<i> New Yorker</i>; it did, according to the magazine’s fiction editor William Maxwell, impress the staff by being—in a remark that says more about the<i> New Yorker </i>fiction department than Hazzard—“the work of a finished literary artist about whom they knew nothing whatever.”)</p>\n<p>In 1963, the year her story collection <i>Cliffs of Fall </i>was published, Hazzard met Francis Steegmuller at a small party hosted by Muriel Spark. (Kit had come to the party, too, but left early to attend an Australia Day party at the consulate—“Thank God,” Shirley wrote in her diary.) Steegmuller was twenty-five years Hazzard’s senior, the author of an acclaimed biography of Flaubert, a widower, and dating someone else, but within six months his situation had resolved in Shirley’s favor, and the two were married that December. The road of love was not always smooth—when Hazzard cried because Steegmuller was underwhelmed by their visit to the Villa Solaia, he offered, “Why don’t we split up?”—but in time they became known as a happy couple. Some of Steegmuller’s biographical subjects were “gay-coded figures,” and in some circles he was assumed or “known” to have male lovers, but Olubas is not convinced and she also quotes sources who doubted it. What is important for her purposes is that Hazzard “found happiness in marriage to a man with inclinations toward literary and artistic figures and subjects marked by complexity rather than transparency, with a preference for the undisclosed rather than the vaunted truth.” She quotes Hazzard’s final novel, <i>The Great Fire</i>: “The experiment of love is itself aberrant, more often than not, and doesn’t lend itself to classification.”</p>\n<p>Hazzard’s first novel, <i>The Evening of the Holiday</i>, was published in 1966, and <i>The Bay of Noon </i>in 1970. Though she followed political events closely and expressed fierce opinions (especially about the United Nations and its conduct), Hazzard generally held herself apart from the left-wing controversies of the day. She and Steegmuller embodied a “gentler sensibility” of art and culture. She was not interested in debates about communism and not sympathetic to the student protesters at Columbia University, though this may have had more to do with her dislike of Diana Trilling, whose writing in favor of the students was riddled with what Hazzard termed “preposterous jargon,” than with any deeply held position. (Hazzard had a little more respect for Lionel, but found him a “wilted” presence; she considered the Trillings aesthetically narrow-minded, and was offended that they didn’t appreciate the “heavenly countryside” around Solaia.) One could say that she emerged from a turbulent period of history with her hair well-coiffed.</p>\n<p>Hazzard had hoped to have a child, but never did; she had one miscarriage, and in the 1970s had a hysterectomy. (Neither event was recorded in her diary.) She and Steegmuller split their time between Manhattan and Italy. When they needed money, he sold a painting from the collection he had inherited from his first wife. They moved in a rarefied world of artists, scholars, and intellectuals, and spent a great deal of time with their friends. Hazzard was socially generous, and eager to bring bright young people into her circle. It was a writers’ life of the sort to make other writers jealous. “To me you do lead an unusually charmed life writing away in the NY apartment and Capri villa while collecting your celebrities and charmers and pairing them off round the world,” Nobel laureate Patrick White wrote to her after reading <i>The Transit of Venus</i>. Shirley did not answer the letter.</p>\n<p><b>THE HAZZARD THAT EMERGES</b> in Olubas’s exhaustive biography is rather like one of Hazzard’s characters: brilliant and cosmopolitan; living through historical events but strangely untouched by generational mores; at once supremely composed and eager to demonstrate her worth. The voice of her diary, like that of her published fiction, was lofty. She disliked much of the Australian writing of the 1970s and ’80s, and in turn, Murray Bail complained of her “prissy aversion to vomit” and “overbearing provincialism.” Hazzard’s prose is precise and gorgeous but dense and sometimes overdone; it can open up immense pools of feeling and flatten feeling out by making every moment richly supercharged. One never hears a car coming in Hazzard. The senses are more finely tuned than that, able to distinguish between “the bronchial change of gear with which a van might mount the hill” and “a swift, decided sound, a sound in showroom condition,” etc. Her sound was always in showroom condition. </p>\n<p>Olubas quotes friends who recall conversation with Hazzard as a spell, a magic web of erudition and quotation. The poet Edward Hirsch says she was “the most cultivated person” he had met. Another poet, Michael Collier, recalls a lunch with Hazzard: “You just felt that you had moved into another landscape.” There were, of course, some who could not be charmed. (According to one of Olubas’s sources, Elizabeth Hardwick and Hazzard “did not get along,” though she doesn’t say why; possibly it had something to do with to the static between Steegmuller and Hardwick’s friend Mary McCarthy over a piece McCarthy wrote about <i>Madame Bovary</i>.) And it was pointed out occasionally, even by her friends, that Hazzard, who so loved to talk, was not an especially good listener. Annabel Davis-Goff said that conversation with Hazzard was a matter of “finding a moment when you could interrupt.” Whether that tendency to monologue was due to temperament or was a consequence of having been intellectually stifled in her youth is not clear; probably it was both. </p>\n<p>In any case it recalls Hazzard’s short story “Harold,” which concerns a quiet boy staying with his mother at an Italian villa much like Solaia. In the story it comes out that the boy writes poems, and someone says what people say in such situations: “I hope you will read them to us.” To everyone’s surprise, the boy immediately goes upstairs to get his papers, and greater surprise still, the room is suddenly transported by his genius. Sharing his work makes the boy “self-possessed”: he gives no mind to the effect he has on the others, and does not look for their approval or commendation. The story is a kind of fantasy about a productive writer (“There are more all the time,” he says of the poems) being entirely sufficient unto himself. Harold needs an audience, but only so he can turn away from it. Something similar seems to have been true for Shirley. </p>\n<p>While Shirley was writing and lunching, Kit was bouncing from New York to London. In the mid-1960s she settled in Sydney, where Valerie took up the thankless job of looking after her. After Kit, who was known about the neighborhood, introduced herself to a bookstore owner as Shirley Hazzard’s mother, the owner called up the writer Elizabeth Harrower and suggested that, as both authors were published by Macmillan, perhaps Harrower could meet Kit. Harrower and Hazzard began to correspond, with the result that Harrower became an unofficial caregiver, picking up some duties that might normally fall to family, such as taking Kit to the doctor and hosting her for Easter weekend. Shirley welcomed Harrower’s involvement while continually complaining that Valerie was not doing her part (in fact Valerie was doing far more than Shirley was). When Kit died, Shirley did not attend the funeral, though this may be due less to how she felt about Kit than to her having not especially formal feelings about death. For example, when Steegmuller died, she did not accompany his body to the crematorium.</p>\n<p>Reading <i>The Transit of Venus</i> provides the satisfaction of pressing hard on a painful bruise. The injuries of love radiate. More than twenty years passed between the publication of that novel and <i>The Great Fire</i>. In those years Hazzard gave lectures, attended the International Congress of Papyrology, and wrote articles about the United Nations. (“The writing of UN articles has just about killed me, and has a lethal effect on real work,” she wrote to Harrower, while nonetheless continuing to write them.) She hosted friends and visitors at three apartments—there was one in Naples, in addition to Manhattan and Capri—in other words, constant distraction. It took her eight years to write the memoir <i>Greene on Capri</i> (2000), a fascinating portrait of Graham Greene and also of Hazzard, whose observations are tartly focused. The book is a kind of joust between the two of them. When Greene notes that a certain place “looks idyllic, but might be hell,” Hazzard does him one better: “Graham was inclined to suspect—in some moods, perhaps to hope—that most idylls might be hell.”</p>\n<p>Hazzard’s time was also taken up in caring for Steegmuller, whose increasingly difficult behavior—she complained in her diary of “the crushing, the neurotic coldness and moodiness, the narcissism”—may have been a symptom of cognitive decline, which worsened in the months before his death in 1994. But perhaps the real reason it took Hazzard so long to write <i>The Great Fire </i>was the difficulty of excavating the material. The novel is based on her relationship with Vedeniapine—“that love I’ll never know again”—“the great great love I began in September 1947, a destiny.” As Olubas puts it, “Her ‘work,’ now, was more than writing the novel; it was ‘reverie’ and a revisiting of days.” It seems Hazzard was able to inhabit what Olubas calls “the anguish of first love” only after her husband’s death; it may have been that she could give herself to the Vedeniapine material not in spite of her grief over Steegmuller, but because of it. One friend said that Hazzard’s mourning, and the story she constructed about her marriage, was like a “shrine” she lived in. It was “so enveloping that there was no sense that she was ever outside it.”</p>\n<p>Hazzard always drew freely from life for her fiction. She wrote diaries and drafts in the same notebook, and Olubas observes that it is “not always possible to distinguish between the two.” And yet drawing on life doesn’t mean that Hazzard confronted it fully. Olubas’s book makes plain that the work of Hazzard’s adulthood was to put the greatest distance possible between herself and her childhood. “The dark comedy with which she invested her mother functioned as a form of protection, walling off the chaos,” Olubas notes. Hazzard herself wrote, of her mother, that “it is so sad that if one were to dwell on the whole of it one could not bear it.” Sublimation is a time-honored practice for us all. But one wonders if Hazzard’s dazzling, even sublime sentences, might have been a bit less marmoreal if she had been less protected, more willing to dwell on the past and her own role in it, less “bored” by it. Was her style—the thick and concrete language, the maze of foreshadowing and indirection, the narrative weave of inevitability and destiny, the all-knowing and faraway point of view—designed to escape some pressing and intolerable knowledge? Or an effort to fix it, to make a beautiful picture to look down on? Of her slow progress on <i>The Great Fire</i>, Hazzard explained to her friend Donald Keene: “In fiction one can correct an ultimate tragedy into a suggestion, at least, of a ‘happy ending.’ That is, set life right, as one can’t manage to do it in reality.” </p>\n<p><a href="https://www.bookforum.com/contributor/christine-smallwood" title="Contributions by Christine Smallwood">Christine Smallwood</a> is the author of the novel <i>The Life of the Mind</i> (Hogarth, 2021).</p>\n',

      '<p><b>WHEN KERRY HOWLEY PUBLISHED HER FIRST BOOK</b>, <i>Thrown</i>, in 2014, bookstores labeled it a “nonfiction novel.” Its journalistic bona fides were somewhat straightforward—Howley embedded with two real lesser-known mixed-martial-arts fighters for three years, documenting the lengths they went to hone and destroy their bodies in real professional combat. The “novel” addendum stemmed from the book’s first-person narrator—a woman identified not as “Kerry” but “Kit,” a philosophy student who wanders out of an academic Husserl conference into a “Midwest Cage Championship,” where she encounters for the first time the subject of her book. Kit is earnest, pretentious, and not self-aware; that combo is why most of <i>Thrown</i>’s jokes are at her expense:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<p>I remember well that first real conversation with Sean, wherein we lunched on satisfactory dive-bar burgers and I told him I thought his performance an extraordinary physical analogue to phenomenological inquiry. He cocked his head, arched an eyebrow, and said, in a way that seemed quietly pleased with my observation, “You’re insane.”</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But Kit, we learn partway through the book, is not real. She’s a persona crafted by Howley, her “(admittedly neurotic) progenitor,” who is “so conscious of her own tendency toward self-confabulation that she hesitates to call anything she says of herself a fact.” Kit is her stand-in, a substitute whose existence is presented as, counterintuitively, an act of radical transparency. “All narrators,” Kit/Kerry says, “are fiction. <i>All</i>. The reliable ones have the decency to admit it.” In a less tactful writer’s hands, this could prove pat or gimmicky. In Howley’s, it doesn’t. She turns the reliability of narration into a point of wry obsession, one that propels her latest, and more overtly nonfiction, book.</p>\n<p><i>Bottoms Up and the Devil Laughs</i>, which drops from Knopf in March, is about the people brave or stupid enough to challenge the narratives of the “deep state” after 9/11. It is a <i>Journalist and the Murderer </i>redux, only the murderers are state-sanctioned, and the journalist is the government. The story the “deep state” tells about itself is, at best, curated; at worst, made up. Flaks broadcast a specific version of events, while actors on the inside must refrain from publicly pointing out errors or spoiling plot points. As intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning has pointed out, there is a significant gap between “two worlds”: “the world in America, and the world I was seeing.” Or, as Howley once described elsewhere, between the world of secret intelligence and the one that plays out on TV. Leaking can bring one world in closer contact with the other. It may also get the leaker in trouble and thus introduce other opposing narratives: the whistleblower’s and the court’s. The latter is as inclined toward confabulation as anyone else; a prosecutor, like Malcolm’s journalist, harbors no delusions about collaborating with his defendant on her case, intending always “to write a story of his own.” But he is far less eager to admit the deception than Howley. “The state’s view of us,” she writes, “is a sticky fiction. It assumes a permanent single self, for one thing, a lumbering anchored persistence.”</p>\n<p>This book is an elaboration on Howley’s twin magazine profiles of two such whistleblowers: the imprisoned former intelligence official Daniel Hale, who smuggled out the files now known as the “Drone Papers,” and the former intelligence contractor Reality Winner, who printed and anonymously mailed a five-page classified document in 2017. Hale’s and Winner’s trajectories shared several key characteristics. Both were members of the United States Air Force who later became contractors with the National Security Agency. Both had “Top Secret” security clearance. Both were given assignments that involved figuring out who to kill with drones in Afghanistan. And both experienced the peculiar discomfort that accompanies top-secret tasks—namely, seeing the minutiae of one’s daily work get turned into a tidier, less gruesome story for public consumption. Both leaked classified documents to the leak-friendly outlet The Intercept and then went to prison.</p>\n<p>Winner’s case structures the book, because, one imagines, of the features that made it unlike the conventional whistleblowing story. There is her name—a case of nominative determinism gone awry—which is indeed real. And there’s the symbolically rich nature of her job, a “cryptologic language analyst” fluent in Pashto, Dari, and Farsi. More importantly, Winner, unlike her more famous predecessors Manning, Hale, and Edward Snowden, did not leak a trove of documents concerning her own intelligence work. She leaked a single file—one she had basically stumbled on while bored and perusing the vast archive of classified documents to which any of the more than two million people with top-secret clearance has access. The report was about a hacking attempt, the success of which remains unclear, by Russian intelligence agents on a sole American elections-tech company in August 2016. Perhaps Howley was also drawn to the fact that the document had been marked ORCON, which means “dissemination and extraction of information controlled by originator.”</p>\n<p>Howley notes that with this document, no one was in control: not the originator—the US Intelligence Community—and certainly not Winner. The Intercept, in whom she had trusted her anonymity, had carelessly sent her material to the NSA for corroboration with identifying watermarks intact, which landed Winner in federal custody days before the article ran. The absorption of the file into American political discourse was perhaps its most ungovernable aspect. The report, with its real but not-extensive evidence of Russian hacking, was perfectly timed to be exploited by a range of agendas, all of which misconstrued what the document actually said.</p>\n<p><b>AMERICA’S BARNES &amp; NOBLES</b> are now filled with hardcovers unpacking any number of Trump-era scandals. More than a few of them are “debunkers” of some kind—they set out to correct what we all, so recently, may have gotten wrong. On a superficial level, Howley has added another spine to that shelf, as she details the misconceptions that plagued Winner’s case. But where the politics of such books are often easy to discern, Howley manages to push beyond partisan hack work to lay bare the flaws or biases in everyone’s read on Reality—be it the right or left, the Intercept or NSA, Winner’s family, her lawyers, or her prosecutors. No one, as Howley puts it in a prefatory note, constructs a “self in the dark.” Winner is, like everyone, “a web of social relationships,” a “map of connections.” Howley is more interested in that map than in Winner’s intentions or ideology. She illustrates the ways in which the raw data of someone’s life can be culled into a story they didn’t know they had told.</p>\n<p>Howley begins by situating Winner in a network of various state enemies. She traces the story back to John Walker Lindh, the twenty-year-old Californian who traveled to Afghanistan to join the Taliban in 2001. Specifically, she starts with Chuck D, the Public Enemy vocalist whose music first led Lindh to Malcolm X, to Ice Cube, to posing as a Black rapper online, to the Nation of Islam, and eventually to Arabic, which he would learn in pursuit of an identity less white, suburban, and morally “impure” than his own. Howley paints Lindh as an adolescent of many extreme if familiar qualities—a persistently searching personality, a disregard for danger, an occasionally grating dogmatism (“Dear Inhabitants of This Room,” he once wrote to some dorm mates, “please abstain from getting naked in front of the window.”) Foremost of these was bad timing; Lindh’s first day on the Taliban’s front lines was September 6, 2001.</p>\n<p>When he was arrested soon after, Lindh became a case study in the American state’s narrative powers. “John Lindh would be allowed only one identity in the end,” Howley writes, “but the contours of that identity were still being negotiated on cable news.” It was President George W. Bush, of all people, who initially offered some empathy; he called Lindh a “poor fellow,” who “thought he was going to fight for a great cause.” That tentative warmth rapidly cooled, as Howley recaps:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<p>“Poor Fellow or Traitor?” asked a headline in the <i>New York Post, </i>which went on to answer its own question, also in the headline. “Looks Like a Rat, Talks Like a Rat, Smells Like a Rat, Hides Like a Rat—It Is a Rat.” Rudolph Giuliani, the mayor of New York City, admitted he didn’t have “all the facts” but added, “I believe the death penalty is the appropriate remedy to consider.” Hillary Clinton called him a “traitor.” Diane Sawyer asked the president’s parents what they thought of their son calling John Walker Lindh a “poor fellow.”</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<p>“Well,” said the president’s mother, “I think the president meant that he’s obviously demented.”                         </p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Howley intersplices Lindh’s progression from Public Enemy fan to the so-called American Taliban with similar scenes from Winner’s childhood—her first word (<i>dada</i>), her second word (<i>no</i>), her frustrations with grade-school soccer (lacking rigor), and her early interest in Arabic, born from a paternal insistence on the “importance of communication, the language and culture that separate us from the other.” Like she did with Lindh, in other words, Howley introduces Winner as a person with context. She fleshes out that background with digressions on Winner’s obvious allies—Snowden, Manning, Hale, Julian Assange—but also less predictable peers: the InfoWars pundit Joseph Biggs; the alleged Al Qaeda official Abu Zubaydah; former CIA agent John Kiriakou, the first official to confirm the US was waterboarding prisoners; and Jesselyn Radack, the former Department of Justice lawyer who defended some of the names on that list. By the time Howley arrives at the story of Winner’s leak, she has methodically primed the reader to see Winner not as a scandal, but as merely one member of a special, if frequently irritating, demographic:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<p>People who feel they must confront the nature of reality, whom we call “whistleblowers” or “traitors,” tend to feel that the rest of us should do the same, which makes those people annoying, because <i>not looking </i>is a skill, and after a while you too might lose the ability to not look.                       </p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One might argue that knowing <i>how</i> to look is the real skill here, partly because Winner came of age at a moment swarmed by stimuli. The past two decades have made it easier than ever to understand anyone’s “map of connections.” On the one hand, government surveillance had long moved past the targeted wiretapping of the Nixon era and into what Howley characterized as “absorb everything, all of it, at once. Stash it somewhere. Worry about it later.” As Howley works her way through whistleblower history, she outlines how the “deep state” began to collect more data than it could manage—and responded by classifying it almost instinctively. By the time Winner secured her clearance, the term “secret” could apply to a report on Russian hacking just as easily as, per one FOIA finding, “an agreement between the 2012 movie <i>Battleship </i>and the U.S. Navy in which the navy is promised ten DVDs.”</p>\n<p>At the same time, the American public was starting to surveil itself in the form of social media, smartphones, and the increasing digitization of basic human activity—shopping, reading, exercising—the cost of which was always our data. “We all have to have the receipts,” Howley says, “receipts for everything, receipts for texts and one-line emails and Facebook messages.” The internet can know us better than even our closest friends. Until this book, for example, only Google had registered the search spiral Howley followed one night, when her new infant wouldn’t stop crying, typing: “<i>colic solutions, baby won’t stop crying, colic peer reviewed studies</i>,” then “<i>pediatrician colic, colic long-term effects, colic average duration</i>,” then “<i>foods breastfeeding colic</i>” and “<i>anxiety drugs safe for breastfeeding</i>,” and finally “<i>adoption</i>.” Of course, with the right subpoenas, the NSA could know this too. She calls her book a “polemic against memory cast into print.”</p>\n<p>One might think that a traceable record of our everyday interactions would make it easier to corroborate our actions or discern our intentions. With endless documentation comes endless proof that our version of events—our Tuesday dentist appointment, our lunch at that hotel with our uncle—really happened. But taken together, those tidbits “form a sclerotic social identity with a strange relation to the real,” Howley writes. And their permanent availability brings—as Winner learned from the news, at trial, in prison—the ability to strip out the backstory, “to tell stories perfectly matched to the intentions of the teller, freed from the complex texture of reality.” Technology has allowed us to narrate our lives all the time and in great detail, but we don’t get to choose who listens or which parts they hear.</p>\n<p>The only real villains in Howley’s story are those who refuse to see the self as David Hume described it in <i>Treatise of Human Nature</i>: “a bundle of different perceptions, which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity, in perpetual flux.” These villains are not, say, Abu Zubaydah, who was alleged to be Bin Laden’s third-in-command and was arrested, jailed, and waterboarded as many as eighty-three times in American custody. Howley introduces him, like Winner, like Lindh, as a person caught in the tangled multiverse of being alive—a person with particularities, like the faulty memory that prompted him to keep “thick diaries full of drawings and spare thoughts” and “10,000 pages of notes written to his future self, whom he calls Hani—the name his mother used for him.” The bad guys here, instead, are the FBI investigators who would reduce those notes to evidence of a “schizophrenic personality.” Or maybe the agents who would use that simplification to justify what they did to him—as Kiriakou did when he maintained, for years after the fact, that waterboarding had worked. As Howley writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<p>This is not just propaganda; it is torture fan fiction. It suggests not only a psychic need to torture but a need to frame it as an act of life-saving heroism. Fairy tales are stories in which darkness precedes transformation, and this is a story for America’s children: We stuffed a man in a small box to set you free.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p><b>THE LONG TITLE OF HOWLEY’S BOOK</b> does not come up until near the end, though it may be familiar to anyone old enough to have been clicking links in 2014. In November of that year, a Christian woman appeared in a YouTube video called “MONSTER Energy drinks are the work of SATAN!!!” in which she detailed how the can design of the chemical-flavored caffeine vehicle revealed Luciferian meddling at work. “You cannot deny that that is a cross,” she said, pointing to a cross in the “o” in “monster” on the can. “And what is witchcraft? When the cross goes upside down,” she explained, inverting the can for a sip. “Bottoms up, and the devil laughs.”</p>\n<p>It is easy to make fun of this woman, as many did when the video first came out. But Howley sees in her speech—“a crisp patter punctuated by forays into Hebrew, textual analysis, paranoid semiotics, and moments of well-timed eye contact”—a kind of prescience. The history of Monster Energy Company is indeed marred by a string of devilish offenses. That included bullying small-time business owners for minor copyright infractions, such as Li Chih, “a man who owns a small online forum called ‘Monster Fish Keepers’ for people who love predatory fish.” Monster Energy did this so often, it earned the distinction of copyright database Trademarkia’s “All-Time Biggest Bully.” And the behavior alleged in lawsuits filed against Monster’s male executives, claiming harassment, retaliation, and in one incident, physical assault. The latter allegedly left a woman with broken nails, a bloody thumb, and “strangle marks on her neck.” The company’s fruit punch is called “Assault,” Howley remarks, before revisiting a line from the video: “If God can use people and product, so can Satan.”</p>\n<p>Howley’s capacity for incisive empathy extends to those whom most would dismiss as kooks. Just as narrators who purport to be reliable can be wrong, she suggests, those whom we write off as unreliable can, on some level, be right. Howley knows, for example, that Trump’s hysteria over “unelected deep-state operatives” has a kernel of truth to it—who else are these inhabitants of America’s bureaucratic underground other than Winner’s faceless tormentors? Trump’s vision of this secret world was, of course, populated by “globalists,” which quickly became “Satan-worshiping pedophiles.” But Howley finds something of value even in QAnon, in whose followers she sees a relentless optimism, an insistence on “making life better, both for yourself and the babies who would otherwise be eaten.”</p>\n<p>The characters who populate her book are all dissidents of some kind, all “moral narcissists—unable to compartmentalize, to ride the wave of whatever mundane evil shapes the lives of their agreeable colleagues.” Wariness of official narratives can be found on the left and the right, among “cryptologic language analysts” or tin-can rune readers. One cannot have Winner without Marjorie Taylor Greene. “Q,” Howley notes, “was a whistleblower.” </p>\n</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.bookforum.com/contributor/tarpley-hitt" title="Contributions by Tarpley Hitt">Tarpley Hitt</a> is a writer at Gawker and an editor at <i>The Drift</i>.</p>\n',

      '<p><b>IT IS MY FAULT</b> and only mine if I keep Gordon Matta-Clark as a personal Jesus, but the story flies. Matta-Clark died, way too early, at the age of thirty-five in 1978, and spent a chunk of his time slicing up abandoned buildings, which is very Jesus-y. One of his building cuts has become a permanent part of Manhattan’s west side—of that, more soon—and he even contributed to New York’s proudest category of impermanence: the restaurant. (RIP Food, Soho, 1971–1989.) Matta-Clark was tuned to frequencies prophetic in nature and number: the glow of decay, the need to befriend ghosts, and the spiritual value of free, the only real price. A theoretical—they called it “behavioral” at the time—architect and conceptual artist of all tools who punctuated houses and freestyled with a saw, Matta-Clark would not likely have walked into the bathroom-coke and podcasts holding cell of today’s art world, had he lived. (He would have been seventy-nine this year.) In my limited but acute imagining, GMC would have been the éminence grise of culture jammers, advising people to let ideas grow mold and break into whatever isn’t locked up. The most sanctified thing he did, after all, was to make art that disappears. As William James points out in <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>, unseen things are central to religious attitudes. That which we believe in, the objects of our consciousness, “may be present only to our thought,” but “the reaction due to things of thought is notoriously in many cases as strong as that due to sensible presences.” What GMC’s work shares with a religious practice is the idea that exegesis is more the point than mere witnessing.</p>\n<p>Matta-Clark is strongest in outline, and this is exactly what David Hammons turned him into. Hammons’s 2021 work <i>Day’s End </i>is a stainless-steel tracing of a warehouse that used to stand on Pier 52, the site of the first <i>Day’s End</i>, Matta-Clark’s 1975 piece. I love the Hammons reimagining because it demands the same kind of thought as the original, while only hinting at Matta-Clark’s cuts, a religious ranking of spirit over matter. Matta-Clark went into this abandoned pier on the west side of Manhattan and cut holes in the structure, largest of them all a massive, leaf-shaped crescent in the far wall. This “cat-eye-like ‘rose window,’” as he described it, faced the Hudson River and was not visible to passersby. Matta-Clark saw <i>Day’s End </i>(also known as <i>Days Passing</i>) as an “indoor park,” and it lasted longer than most of his building cuts, more than two years. Since then, the original work has lived as the subject of a film and a set of photos. What Hammons designed makes no reference to the shapes Matta-Clark cut, so it technically refers only to the warehouse, originally owned by a railroad company. But this is all Matta-Clark did anyway: ask us to think about a building. He is now a fixture of NYC, through Hammons, as the new <i>Day’s End </i>is maintained by a trust.</p>\n<p>There is a beautiful photo of GMC sitting on a wooden platform and carving the outline of the <i>Day’s End </i>wall hole in <i>Gordon Matta-Clark: An Archival Sourcebook</i>, edited by Gwendolyn Owens and Philip Ursprung. These two scholars scoured the Gordon Matta-Clark Archive in Montreal and did a remarkable job of stitching together letters and scraps of paper to convey what GMC thought about and how. Since he didn’t leave behind a vast series of artifacts, books like this may be how GMC “happens” more than he happens in any gallery. Hearing so much of Matta-Clark’s own voice here gives us that much more to work with.</p>\n<p>The father to Matta-Clark’s son and holy ghost combo was Roberto Matta, Chilean Surrealist and art-world heavy. In 1971, Gordon wrote to him, thanking him for a “fabulous gift” that helped him through “another difficult period of rent and expenses.” The younger Matta wished he could “realize a few sales on my work, but it is pretty hard for others to accept.” He goes on to explain why this is so, and summarizes much of what he ended up doing in the years before his death.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<p>I have worked with some fairly unusual materials and operations in making sculpture, making curious preparations out of food, seaweed, and vegetable matter. I have had something less than a rave response to these initial inventions—but I keep confronting new situations all the time. In the past few weeks I have done my first outdoor piece in New York, my first theater performance, my first slide lecture, my first lecture to college students in another city. . . . So, though I am not sure what it all means, there is little time to lose in doubt and hesitation. Of course I sell nothing and am completely out of the conventional gallery system so everything is experimental . . . which means that I am still learning in a real situation.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a 1974 interview, Liza Béar asks the artist about his tendency to modify buildings about to be demolished—in this case, the small home in Englewood, New Jersey, that was the object in <i>Splitting</i>. GMC describes it as “substandard housing in bedroom suburbia near the Lackawanna railroad.” Béar asks, “But aren’t you partly drawn to something that’s about to collapse?” My Jesus engine kicks in here, as I expect him to talk about the kingdom of heaven in the ruins. That’s not what happens. GMC tells Béar that he knows these situations “bring up romantic associations” but that he chooses buildings largely based on expediency. “I’d much sooner do something right across the street,” he says. “I’d just as soon deal with something that’s brand new, crisp, and not at all ready for the ax.” Which is not to say he was against magic, or at least the charm of the unexpected. “One aspect of buildings I’ve worked on which may be considered romantic is that they’re in unexpected locations, but the unexpected is not dependent on the particular disintegrated quality that they have.”</p>\n</p>\n<div class="article-image-container">\n<div class="blog-article__image blog-article__image--portrait">\n        <af-more-images-link :article-id="25155" :image-id="60424" article-title="Director’s Cut" :image-names=\'["article"]\'><br />\n                        <img decoding="async" src="//www.bookforum.com/uploads/upload.000/id25155/article00_large.jpg" alt="Gordon Matta-Clark performing Tree Dance at Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, New York, 1971. © Estate of Gordon Matta-Clark/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York; Courtesy the Estate of Gordon Matta-Clark."><br />\n        </af-more-images-link><figcaption class="blog-article__caption">\n            <b>Gordon Matta-Clark performing <i>Tree Dance</i> at Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, New York, 1971.</b> © Estate of Gordon Matta-Clark/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York; Courtesy the Estate of Gordon Matta-Clark.<br />\n        </figcaption></div>\n</div>\n<p>These qualities are evident in the photographs he made in several abandoned buildings for <i>Bronx Floors </i>(1972–73), a work that was designed to live beyond the life span of the houses being cut. If art is supposed to make us look at what already exists and absorb its contradictions without the fear that consciousness brings, his building cuts are among the finest art of the twentieth century. These buildings—to whom did they belong? The great architects of the late nineteenth century? To the people who last lived there? To the gallery exhibiting <i>Bronx Floors</i>? To Matta-Clark? The photos show a geometrically gorgeous series of receding frames, a parallelogram punching downward through lathe work and rubble, reminding us both how impressive and fragile the city’s infrastructure is, how easily it is converted into a perspectival game. Kids were jumping out of windows onto mattresses in the South Bronx. (See Manfred Kirchheimer’s 1981 film <i>Stations of the Elevated </i>for footage of exactly that.) Gordon jumped right through the center of these homes, and none of it was sponsored by Smirnoff or Squarespace. As he told Béar, “I just wanted to get back to whatever the empty rooms were made of, like the layers of linoleum on the floor, or whatever there was of surfaces.”</p>\n<p>The Béar interview is, by itself, one of the single best introductions to Matta-Clark and his thought, but there are other equally valuable documents here. We can imagine that this scrap from 1972 was deadly serious because GMC would have done both of these things: “Plans to break / into the / Democratic National / Headquarter in / Washing D. C. / Plan to break / into a / A road runner / breaking the / speed limit.” In 1976, he told Donald Wall, “One of my favorite definitions of the difference between architecture and sculpture is whether there is plumbing or not.” </p>\n<p>What makes this my favorite Matta-Clark book to date is that it is told primarily in his voice, through letters he wrote and interviews he gave. His short life and shorter career has, to date, induced a sort of protective vomiting in researchers, who often include everything they have found of his, or thought about him, in order to balance the void he left or possibly fully explain what made this enigma so important. More is not more with GMC, though. Owens and Ursprung are prudent, and have arranged <i>Sourcebook </i>chronologically, selecting texts from each year, carefully; also, their brief editorial incursions are welcome. This one note from the editors is simple but as illuminating as a string of LED: “A graduate of Cornell University’s School of Architecture, Matta-Clark distinguished himself as an outstanding student. Yet to some friends he presented himself as someone who barely made it through the program.” GMC operates in a weird trench; he came from privilege and yet worked outside most of what it might have provided him. His Marlboro Man via Marx routine probably helped him more than his last name, though it’s impossible to tell, especially in an art world that had yet to go through the financialization of the ’80s. Had GMC had the opportunity to upscale his work to stock-market heights and start breathing in tandem with the gallery cycle, he well might have. (The Estate of Gordon Matta-Clark joined the David Zwirner Gallery in 1998.) GMC was hardly doctrinaire or predictable; nor was he, the careful reader will have noticed, any kind of Jesus. He was an artist, a hard-working and extremely flexible one. When Donald Wall suggested that the residue of the <i>Splitting </i>house might end up in the Hirshhorn, Matta-Clark gave a response that works as a placeholder answer to “What would Gordon be doing in 2022?”: “I mean, if someone in the museum was really interested in my work,” Matta-Clark said, “they would let me cut open the building.”</p>\n<p>While working in 1977 on <i>Descending Steps for Batan</i>, a tribute to his brother Sebastian (Batan), Matta-Clark wrote to Jane Crawford (soon to be his wife) on a “glossy” card: “Despite my serious attempt at heavy underground imagery it all turns pretty (as in photos) or funny—what a perfectly ridiculous way to make a living (is it a way to make a living?).” There are so many delightful notes here, like this answer GMC gave during an exchange in 1978, about the reactions to <i>Splitting</i>. “I received a lot of mail, much of it positive but among the angry letters was one from an architect who said I was violating the sanctity and dignity of abandoned buildings by interrupting their transition to ruin or demolition.” And then: “Why hang things on a wall when the wall itself is so much more a challenging medium?”</p>\n<p><i>Sourcebook </i>improves the more time I spend with it. There is so much that was previously unclear that the archives have made at least clearer, if not definitive. Matta-Clark came from art royalty, but that doesn’t seem to have provided a financial cushion for him. In one letter, he asks his father for money, and much of the correspondence sees him looking to artistic organizations around the world for money and staffing for his various projects. (His budgets are small and he emphasizes that he is “flexible.”) In February of 1978, only months before his death, he talks to Judith Russi Kirshner of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, for whom he’s recently completed a building cut. (The building was attached to the MCA and torn down soon after Matta-Clark chopped it up.) “My posture has been unemployment, artistic unemployment for years, so that turning things down really isn’t my habit.” Anarchitecture was, as Owens and Ursprung write, “loosely defined as architecture of the accidental or the mundane,” and this term “would come to be used in connection with the whole of his oeuvre.” There was supposed to be an Anarchitecture show at the 112 Greene Street gallery, and an invitation card was printed, but there are “no reviews or firsthand accounts to confirm that the exhibition took place,” as Ursprung and Owens write. The notes for potential Anarchitecture pieces he sent in letters to Carol Goodden are perfect conceptual pieces in themselves, as seen in this “word work” he sent to Goodden in 1973:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<p>Word Works Part II</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<p>A) The space it takes to house enemies</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<p>The space it takes to house lovers</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<p>The space it takes to dodge a bullet</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<p>The space it takes to remove a bullet</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<p>The space it takes to remove your hat</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<p>The space it takes to remove your house</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<p>The space it takes to remove your house</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>GMC was, possibly, as much performer and priest as he was artist, someone who depended on the fleeting charge of human presence to illuminate and complete his work. The vitality of the passing moment (and the passerby) is not a friend to the art market but it was his muse. As he told Donald Wall, “My work is performance-based but not intended for other people to watch. It’s very much for a private audience of one—myself. And the house, of course.” Should you succeed in collecting anything of his, don’t worry—you haven’t. As he said about those who collect the debris from his cuts, “Amazing, the way people steal stones from the Acropolis. Even if they are good stones, they are not the Acropolis.” </p>\n</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.bookforum.com/contributor/sasha-frere-jones" title="Contributions by Sasha Frere-Jones">Sasha Frere-Jones</a> is a writer and musician from New York.
