Only two ages are available to women: infantile—and too old. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNo one understood the injustice of the girlish imperative better than the French writer and provocateur Colette, who made her debut in the guise of an adolescent narrator. Claudine is fifteen when we meet her in \u003ci\u003eClaudine at School \u003c/i\u003e(1900), the opening installment of Colette’s first series. Mischievous, quick-witted, and sexually precocious, Claudine is a charming constellation of contradictions, at once a girl and a living rebuke to the myth of innocent girlishness. Her father leaves her largely to her own devices, and her days are devoted to rambling around the woods, teasing her teachers, and bullying her schoolmates, who are\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eso young lady-ish that they annoy me. They’re frightened of being scratched by brambles; they’re frightened of little creatures such as hairy caterpillars and those pretty heath spiders that are as pink and round as pearls; they squeal, they get tired—in fact, they’re insufferable. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eClaudine is such a defiantly feral specimen that it is difficult to say whether she reinvents girlishness—or whether she rejects it altogether. In the second of the Claudine novels, \u003ci\u003eClaudine in Paris \u003c/i\u003e(1901), Claudine’s elegant gay friend Marcel strikes onlookers as “much more of a girl than she is,” and when she marries the inevitably middle-aged Renaud in the third book in the series, she discovers “how much more feminine he is than I am!” Even in marriage, the state that befits a demure young woman, proper girlishness evades the incorrigible Claudine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eColette’s heavily autobiographical first novels are a fitting introduction to her work, both by dint of their preoccupations and by dint of the circumstances of their publication. They were written at the urging of Henri Gauthier-Villars, Colette’s first husband and a pillar of the Parisian demimonde who was fourteen years her senior. A music critic second and a carouser first, Gauthier-Villars appended the pseudonym “Willy” to the novels that he made little secret of outsourcing to a veritable army of ghostwriters. The Claudine novels first appeared under this name, and it was Gauthier-Villars who collected the considerable profits when they became best-sellers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class="article-image-container"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class="blog-article__image blog-article__image--landscape"\u003e\n        \u003caf-more-images-link :article-id="25173" :image-id="60428" article-title="Supreme Courtesan" :image-names=\'["article"]\'\u003e\n                        \u003cimg src="//www.bookforum.com/uploads/upload.000/id25173/article00_1064x.jpg" alt="Colette, Paris, ca. 1907."\u003e\n        \u003c/af-more-images-link\u003e\n        \u003cfigcaption class="blog-article__caption"\u003e\n            \u003cb\u003eColette, Paris, ca. 1907.\u003c/b\u003e \n        \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLater, Colette would become infamous for her string of lesbian affairs, her stint in the theater (especially her performances in drag), and her brief affair with her second husband’s sixteen-year-old son. But she was twenty—and achingly inexperienced—when she left the Burgundian countryside to accompany Willy to Paris. She had yet to develop her characteristically cheerful disdain for convention, and it was largely in print that she was able to mount resistance to the exploitative terms of her marriage. No wonder that the Claudine novels, the first of which was completed when Colette was only twenty-four, already evince their author’s fascination with the jejunity that defines femininity, the young girls who struggle to achieve it, the older women who struggle to retain it, and the men who are eager to profit from it. For the rest of Colette’s life, the figure of the girl would dominate her work: her two most commercially successful works, the Claudine novels and the 1944 novella \u003ci\u003eGigi\u003c/i\u003e, both follow teenagers involved with older men. But even when Colette seems to take up the opposite theme—that of old age—she is in fact approaching the question of girl from the inverse angle. Can girls survive their maturation? Can women juggle the conflicting imperatives to muster girlish docility and maternal authority? And what happens when they cannot? In perhaps Colette’s most haunting story, “The Kepi,” an older woman is thrust into a second adolescence by a mad passion for a younger lieutenant. Despite the woman’s efforts to appear youthful, she makes the fatal mistake of trying on her lover’s kepi after a tryst. All at once, he sees\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\n    \n\n\u003cp\u003ethe slack breasts and the slipped shoulder straps of the crumpled chemise. And the leathery, furrowed neck, the red patches on the skin below the ears, the chin left to its own devices and long past hope. . . . And that groove, like a dried-up river, that hollows the lower eyelid after making love, and that vinous, fiery flush that does not cool off quickly enough when it burns on an aging face. And crowning all that, the kepi! The kepi—with its stiff lining and its jaunty peak, slanted over one roguishly winked eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman’s male friends discuss her predicament unsympathetically. One remarks that her “most urgent duty was to remain slender, charming, elusive.” The other replies, “she fondly supposed that being the forty-six-year-old mistress of a young man of twenty-five was a delightful adventure.” “Whereas it’s a profession,” the first man affirms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut Colette’s most marvelous and mature reckonings with age and youth, the newly and gracefully translated \u003ci\u003eChéri \u003c/i\u003e(1920) and \u003ci\u003eThe End of Chéri \u003c/i\u003e(1926), demonstrate the derangement of infancy extended beyond its natural limits. A woman who refuses to submit to the standard set by the girl grows old with poise, while a perpetually puerile young man remains pitiful forever. Male or female, Colette concludes, an eternal child is doomed to grow grotesque.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAT THE BEGINNING OF \u003ci\u003eCHÉRI\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e, the elegant Léa de Lonval is forty-nine and “approaching the end of a successful career as a well-heeled courtesan.” She is still unapologetically voluptuous, a devotee of “order, beautiful linens, aged wines, refined cuisine” with a rare talent for aestheticizing even daily drudgeries. For lunch, she lingers over “dry Vouvray and the June strawberries served, with their stems, on a faience dish the color of a wet green frog.” Her house is opulently appointed, lit with roseate lamps. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHer lover, the titular Chéri, is twenty-four, “with a white marble face that look[s] invincible.” Despite his formidable beauty, he craves a mistress who can double as a surrogate mother—and Léa, who only half-jokingly calls the affair “an adoption,” is eager to oblige. Corralled into the unenviable role of young-girl-\u003ci\u003ecum\u003c/i\u003e-old-mother, she dusts powder over her wrinkles and applies henna to the graying roots of her hair—even as she babies her young protégé, catering to his every whim. During their affair, she addresses him exclusively by his childhood pet name, never by the unbearably pedestrian “Fred,” and in her internal monologues he goes by the moniker of the “bratty nursling.” For his part, Chéri calls his caretaker “Nounoune,” the endearment he devised for her in his infancy, since which time she has maintained an “irascible friendship” with his mother. Chéri’s adoption has lasted six years, but when his eponymous novel opens, he is at last on the verge of making a suitable marriage to a wealthy girl his own age. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLéa does not think she is in love with Chéri, and she is surprised to find herself heartbroken when her bratty nursling departs on his honeymoon. She feels so horrible that she takes her temperature to determine whether she is ill. The results are revealing: “So, it’s not physical,” she observes sensibly. “It’s that I’m suffering. Something’s going to have to be done about this.” Much is done in due course, all of it in Léa’s characteristically unsentimental style. A trip is planned; elaborate meals are eaten; appearances are maintained. When Léa returns to Paris months later, she prepares for a visit to Chéri’s mother, telling herself, \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\n    \n\n\u003cp\u003etwo women, a little bit older than last year; their usual malice and idle chitchat, their mild suspicions, the meals they share; reading the financial papers in the morning, exchanging spicy gossip in the afternoon: all of this has to start over again, because it’s life, because it’s my life. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is her life—and she is heroically up to the challenge of it, even in the aftermath of what she knows to be her last great love. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut the pampered Chéri does not have Léa’s flair for living bravely in the face of difficulties. He misses not just his lover but the idyll she so artfully conjured—the pastries she ordered for him in the mornings, the lavish comforts of her well-furnished house. When he returns from his honeymoon, he plays truant, holing up in a hotel and avoiding his wife and mother. At last he can hold out no longer, and he materializes in his old mistress’s bedroom in the middle of the night. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike the protagonist of “The Kepi,” Léa understands that being the mistress of a man of twenty-five is a profession, even a discipline. Chéri has never “surprised her unkempt, or with her bodice unlaced, or wearing slippers during the day.” But when he appears after such a prolonged absence, she emits “a short burst of stifled laughter” and realizes with horror that she is “close to abandoning herself to the most terrible joy of her life.” It is too late to avert the catastrophe: “her caution, born of experience; the cheerful common sense, which had guided her life; the doubts and humiliations of her advancing years; along with her acts of renunciation; all of these shrank and vanished before the presumptuous violence of love.” Like so many of Colette’s male characters, Chéri cannot forgive the woman he supposedly adores for her outburst of unseemly humanity. When he glimpses Léa’s face “with no make-up on yet, a meager braid of hair on her nape,” he is repulsed. Devastated but realistic, Léa recognizes the change in her adoptee’s mien, instantly grasps what it betokens, and sends him off to grow up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn \u003ci\u003eThe Last of Chéri\u003c/i\u003e, several years have passed, but Chéri has yet to mature. The bratty nursling has witnessed the horrors of the front without graduating to “Fred.” His admirably efficient wife, from whom he is politely estranged, runs a military hospital; his mother makes savvy financial investments and plans dinner parties. While these capable females bustle around him, Chéri disintegrates. Whenever he catches sight of his face in the mirror, he experiences a “mild shock”: he cannot “comprehend that this was no longer the exact image of a twenty-four-year-old,” nor can he accept that Léa is nearly sixty. When at last he pays a visit to her in her new apartment he thinks, “Who can that old woman be?” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHis former lover has grown unrecognizably “vast, invested with a generous development of every part of her body.” Her arms are “as fat as thighs,” and her careless attire bespeaks “the usual abdication and withdrawal from femininity.” But much to Chéri’s outrage, this monstrous perversion of his romanticized memories appears to be at peace with her condition. She carries on calmly, recommending a hearty neighborhood restaurant and musing, “I’m glad to remember what we had. I’m quite happy with my past. I’m quite happy with my present.” Chéri recoils in horror. “She’s trying to make me believe it’s easy, even enjoyable, to turn into an old woman,” he thinks. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eLet her tell that to other people! Let her tell them her fibs about what a good life she has, about the bistro with its country cooking. But not me! I was born surrounded by fifty-year-old beauties, electric massagers, and smoothing creams! Not me, who’s seen all of my painted pixies fighting over the suggestion of a wrinkle. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut even when Chéri rudely asks his former lover and adoptive mother if she intends to get dressed to go out, Léa refuses embarrassment. “And in what, milord, would you like me to get dressed?” she laughs. “I am dressed. . . . Dressed for living, I’m telling you! In things that are easy, comfortable.” But while a beaming Léa gorges herself on country cooking, Chéri is wasting away, eating so little that he becomes “almost incorporeal.” There is not much left for him to destroy when he kills himself. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Chéri came his prototype, Clouk, a character who appeared in a number of loosely linked stories. “When I gave birth to this beautiful young man,” Colette reports, “he was ugly, something of a runt, and sickly.” Later, he “cast off his pale little slough like a molting snake, emerged gleaming, devilish, unrecognizable.” But in fact Chéri bears more of a resemblance to his frail predecessor than Colette cares to admit. Even the bratty nursling’s beauty cannot save him from his triviality. One night his wife watches him sleep and thinks, “How insignificant he is.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eCOLETTE’S ULTIMATE ANSWER\u003c/b\u003e to the question of girls and their expiration is that they cannnot last: either they fall from grace despite their best efforts, as in “The Kepi,” or they deliberately embrace old age with a haughty and honest dignity, as in \u003ci\u003eThe End of Chéri\u003c/i\u003e. Indeed, Colette favors women who cast off the mantle of girlhood much earlier, sometimes even as early as adolescence. At fifteen, Claudine is already too independent to count as much of a girl—and, truth be told, the bratty nursling has no right to be so scandalized by Léa’s transformation, for her end state is no more than the logical extension of her initial trajectory. “Marriage between an old woman and a young man subverts the very ground rule of relations between the two sexes,” writes Sontag. “Women are supposed to be the associates and companions of men, not their full equals—and never their superiors.” Léa was always too competent and too redoubtable to resign herself to the coquettishness that Chéri expected of her, even as he also demanded that she serve as his obliging parent. In \u003ci\u003eThe End of Chéri\u003c/i\u003e, she has at last advanced beyond the constraints of gender to achieve the “sexless dignity” at which her conduct had always gestured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut the feint of girlishness is not without its benefits, for the project and production of womanhood provides a rigorous education. To be the mistress of a younger man—to be a girl at all, but especially to be a girl forever—is indeed a profession. For once, Chéri recognizes the truth of the matter when he coldly appraises his young wife and reflects, unimpressed, that her natural beauty is “not fair.” The invocation that hovers in the air, implicit yet palpable, is of Léa, whose beauty is earned by her labors at the dressmaker’s and the makeup table. Colette is often described as an apolitical writer, and at least one critic has pronounced her a specialist in “amoral” female characters, but many of her most memorable protagonists embody a quiet and unostentatious morality: their virtues consist in their ruthless social intelligence and their quiet but heroic capacity for getting on with things. Léa is beautiful because she has the acumen and the courage to make herself so, even when every social force conspires to convince her that she is beyond beauty, beyond relevance. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut if girlishness takes work—and refusing to be a girl takes not just work but daring—what does manliness take? Colette’s biographer, Judith Thurman, notes that the men in her subject’s fiction “tend to be shallow, yet however terribly they behave, she pities them as the weaker sex.” They are flabby, self-indulgent, and utterly without resilience. They never have to master the difficult art of self-curation, and as a result, they are stunted. The girl grows up while the man stays boyish forever. Claudine ripens into Léa, but Chéri simply rots. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href="https://www.bookforum.com/contributor/becca-rothfeld" title="Contributions by Becca Rothfeld"\u003eBecca Rothfeld\u003c/a\u003e is a contributing editor at \u003ci\u003eThe Point \u003c/i\u003eand the \u003ci\u003eBoston Review\u003c/i\u003e.

He was sent to boarding school at the age of five, and it left him with a bitter feeling toward his country’s ruling institutions, even as he would remain thoroughly a creature of them. There was a disconnect between his messy homelife and the orthodox Anglicanism of his schooling. He had a fascination with monks but they couldn’t have been more different from his father Ronnie, a divorcé (le Carré’s mother left him when the boy was five) and a criminal who would soon be exposed in the press as a heavy-duty con man after a bankruptcy that made headlines. “I began to think,” he recalled, “that I was the plaything of ridiculous forces, on the one hand this rackety criminality, on the other hand this toffee-nosed high-school style and I fled it really.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRonnie Cornwell would be the model for Rick Pym, father of the double agent at the center of his son’s 1986 novel \u003ci\u003eA Perfect Spy\u003c/i\u003e. “A theme of the novel,” le Carré wrote to his aunt Ella Haymes, who along with her sister Ruby was upset by the book (or at least its reception—they hadn’t read it), “is that hypocrisy thrives upon the silence and the goodheartedness of respectable people, and that deceit, when it passes unchallenged, can be bestowed upon one generation by another.” He enclosed a more “affectionate” portrait by his older brother Tony, an unpublished essay titled “My Brother’s Father and Mine,” in which Ronnie is described as “a picaresque, charming, maddening man.” Ronnie had died a decade earlier. Le Carré paid for the funeral but did not attend it. After the instability and shame of his childhood, he had to endure his father taking credit for his writing talent (Ronnie neither wrote nor was much of a reader), ordering copies of his novels on credit without paying for them, then selling them signed “From the author’s father.” He told an audience in 1997: “I was brought up in a bookless household, and I have a natural sympathy for people who grow up without the example of reading, or come late to it, or never come at all.” It was his stepmother Jean who read to him \u003ci\u003eThe Wind in the Willows \u003c/i\u003eonce when he was sick and bedridden, his earliest literary memory. She would be an affectionate correspondent of her stepson’s until her death, still sending him sweaters for his birthday into his forties. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen le Carré was sixteen, his father pulled him out of Sherborne School and sent him to Bern University to study German. His housemaster, R. S. Thompson, was sad to lose the sensitive boy who won prizes for his poetry: “He strikes me as the sort who might become either Archbishop of Canterbury or a first rate criminal!” It was another teacher at Sherborne, Frank King, who brought him to German literature. “He spoke excellent German,” le Carré said, “and he always reminded us in German class, as everyone was demonising Germany with justice, that there was another Germany, an enduring one and a much older one and a wise and loveable Germany.” King had also been an officer in the Military Intelligence Service during the war. In Bern, le Carré “assumed German identity and German culture as a replacement of my own. That’s where it began.” Soon he would be recruited to the British Intelligence Corps in Bern. It was membership in that order, along with his poetic sensibilities, that would determine the unlikely course of the rest of his life. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring this phase, on a holiday in Saint Moritz in 1950, he met Ann Sharp, the daughter of a Royal Air Force officer. His father, she recalled, was using his son “as bait for the daughter of a possible client.” Le Carré would marry Ann in 1954. She is the addressee of many of the early missives collected in \u003ci\u003eA Private Spy: The Letters of John le Carré\u003c/i\u003e, edited by their son Tim Cornwell, a journalist who died after finishing work on the volume this past May. Le Carré was an avid skier and his letters to Ann combine details of his injuries on the slopes with sweet and unbridled notes of longing for her, shades of the romantic effusiveness shared by many of the characters he would later create. Here he is in 1951 recovering from a fall on the slopes where he injured his left thigh:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eSorry my writing is a bit groggy, but I have just been given some pills to make me sleep.

Escaped in true E. Phillips Oppenheim by laying out an Other Rank guard and removing his braces \u0026amp; tying him up, and stealing his revolver. Masqueraded as a publican from Doncaster. All rather fun, but cut my hand a little in the fight.” Oppenheim was a popular pulp spy novel writer of the early twentieth century; in a public feud over the Kim Philby affair in the late 1960s, Graham Greene, one of le Carré’s early supporters—he provided a crucial blurb for \u003ci\u003eThe Spy Who Came in from the Cold\u003c/i\u003e: “the best spy story I have ever read”—would disparagingly compare the younger writer to Oppenheim. (Greene and le Carré made up and continued a correspondence of mutual admiration.) Later, stationed in Austria, le Carré writes to Ann of sharing a train compartment with thirty Soviet soldiers also engaged in the ongoing occupation: “We smoked cigarettes together, but they refused to speak to me, or even say ‘Goodbye’ when they got out of the train.” Austria itself in 1951 was “a hot-bed of Communism now, and the up \u0026amp; coming breeding ground for international intrigue of every description.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter his year of military service, le Carré went to Oxford, where he continued his studies in German as well as his intelligence work, hanging around leftist circles to report back to MI5. He was a gifted illustrator, and \u003ci\u003eA Private Spy\u003c/i\u003e includes a front page of the \u003ci\u003eOxford Left\u003c/i\u003e newspaper’s “Special Peace Issue” with an illustration of his, of crippled refugees in a postapocalyptic landscape, for an editorial advocating nuclear abolition. The paper’s editor Stanley Mitchell was among those he informed on. Around this time Ronnie’s property frauds—the resulting debts in excess of £1,000,000—were exposed in the press. The checks for his son’s university fees were bouncing to boot. Beyond the desperate hustle for money from generous friends that ensued, Ronnie’s crimes were a source of deep shame to his son: “Suffice it to say, that my father has revealed himself both through his police-related and his private affairs to be an infinite, darkest swindler,” he wrote to Kaspar von Almen, a friend from his Bern days. “The clothes I wore, the food I ate and the books I read were bought with the money this had provided. Little old ladies in the Midlands had provided every penny of their savings towards some lunatic scheme which never existed—honest good Bürgers had been \u003ci\u003elegally\u003c/i\u003e robbed and ruined, whilst I fattened and grazed on their pastures.” And to the Reverend Vivian Green, a mentor at both Sherborne and Oxford who would marry le Carré and Ann in 1954: “I’ve always wanted to become a Christian, and try \u0026amp; live like one.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class="article-image-container"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class="blog-article__image blog-article__image--portrait"\u003e\n        \u003caf-more-images-link :article-id="25148" :image-id="60366" article-title="Cold Snap" :image-names=\'["article"]\'\u003e\n                        \u003cimg src="//www.bookforum.com/uploads/upload.000/id25148/article00_1064x.jpg" alt="John le Carré and his half-sister Charlotte Cornwell, ca. 1956.

He writes in disgust to Ann Sharp on May 26, 1953, a week before the coronation of Elizabeth II: “There is Coronation beer, Coronation toothpaste and Coronation licensing laws. . . . What a far better investment it is not to sell the Crown Jewels, but to line them for view on a queen’s head, for dollars, francs, pesetas, rupees, marks, obols or what you will. What a pity that a national gift for tradition has become a national opportunity for dishonesty.” The disgust with commerce would be echoed by “bloody” Bill Haydon—a traitor and as such not exactly an authorial stand-in—in \u003ci\u003eTinker Tailor Soldier Spy\u003c/i\u003e: “He spoke not of the decline of the West, but of its death by greed and constipation.” At the end of the letter to Ann, le Carré says he will be going to London for a cocktail party at the Soviet Embassy, without mentioning that his purpose was to pose as a leftist sympathizer for MI5.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Oxford, le Carré took a job teaching German and French at Eton College. “I’m not a bit sure I can stand the Eton pace!” he wrote to Green. “I don’t think I’ve ever met \u003ci\u003eso\u003c/i\u003e much arrogance.” Certainly the reputation of Eton’s students (think of Boris Johnson, whom le Carré calls an “Etonian oik” in a late letter) comes through in his correspondence. The boys’ essays “are very clever—clever and crammed with idiotic careless mistakes.” There were new temptations on campus at the time: “there is a curious lowering of standards among the aristocracy e.g. Lord C. Spencer Churchill (aged 16) [descendant of Cornelius Vanderbilt and a son of the tenth duke of Marlborough] tells me that he spends his evenings with father glued to the television.” Even among the intellectual students, there “is an infuriating tradition of not being enthusiastic about anything, or surprised. Hence discussions on painting for instance are somewhat limited by the extent to which a boy will confess himself impressed.” Many believed the withering portrait of a boarding school in his second novel, \u003ci\u003eA Murder of Quality\u003c/i\u003e, was based more on Eton than on Sherborne. (The 1991 TV adaptation, with Denholm Elliott and Christian Bale, would be shot at Sherborne.) Yet it wasn’t all bad, or not as bad as the time le Carré had spent at school: “There is astonishing liberalism in many ways—not the least of these being the number of boys who are so terribly bad at games that Sherborne would have had a fit, and whose lives remain unimpaired by this handicap.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLe Carré worked full-time in the intelligence service, for MI5 in London and for MI6 in Germany, from 1958 until 1963, when his fame as the author of \u003ci\u003eThe Spy Who Came in from the Cold \u003c/i\u003e(his third book but the first with significant sales and recognition) made him useless as a spook, even under a pseudonym. (Kim Philby had blown his cover to the Soviets by this time anyway.) The letters from this phase are few and light on detail. The record picks up when he begins correspondence as an author. Not yet famous, he writes to a family friend: “I have decided to cultivate that intense, worried look and to start writing brilliant, untidy letters for future biographers. This is one.” It is amusing to read his letter to Hilary Rubinstein, an editor who worked on his first novel, \u003ci\u003eCall for the Dead\u003c/i\u003e, to answer the questions of a lawyer: “The characters \u003ci\u003eare \u003c/i\u003ewholly fictitious, and so is the Secret Service setting—so far as I am capable of judging I know of no Government office at or near Cambridge Circus, but I do not suppose the Secret Service publicises the location of its offices. My reading on the subject has always led me to the belief that the Intelligence work is divided between separate services and you will notice that in my book there is only one service, which I suppose reduces the risk of a chance similarity.” How coy! Of course, he knew that MI5 was in Mayfair and MI6 was in Westminster—he had worked for both. Combining the services and moving them to Cambridge Circus put his characters in spitting distance of Soho, the better to allow for random binges at the pub and casual visits by George Smiley to the rare booksellers on Charing Cross Road. All the better to put a bit of space between them and the clubs of St. James’s Square. And the option of referring to the whole operation as the Circus—there in one word was all the intrigue, all the dysfunction, all the fun. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is plenty of trivia about the Smiley books and their adaptations in the correspondence. In 1978, le Carré wrote a flattering letter to Alec Guinness, saying that he and producer Jonathan Powell and screenwriter Arthur Hopcraft “agreed on one thing: that if we were to cry for the moon, we would cry for Guinness as Smiley, and build everything else to fit.” The only quality of the character’s he lacked was “plumpness.” (Indeed, on his first appearance Smiley is described as “a shrunken toad” in bad clothes.) “Some actors can act intelligent,” le Carré asserted in a second letter courting the actor. “Others are intelligent and come over dull, because of some mannerism which gets in the way. And a very few are intelligent and convey it: in \u003ci\u003eTinker Tailor\u003c/i\u003e this gift will be pure gold, because it gives such base to the other things—the solitude, the moral concern, the humanity of Smiley—all, because of the intelligence of his perceptions, grow under our eyes and in your care.” For all the flattery of the initial approach, le Carré later said he preferred Gary Oldman’s performance of the role in Tomas Alfredson’s 2011 film. In a 1980 letter to his stepmother, he mentions that Stanley Kubrick wanted to make a film of \u003ci\u003eSmiley’s People\u003c/i\u003e, but he turned him down to stick with Guinness and the BBC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBeginning with \u003ci\u003eThe Honourable Schoolboy\u003c/i\u003e (1977), the second installment in the Karla trilogy set largely in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, le Carré’s novels became journalistic enterprises. He would undertake extensive travel and recruit sources, often paying them handsomely for their time. The subjects of his post–Cold War novels were various: big pharma, the war on terror, conflict in the Caucasus, arms smuggling, etc. By the time of the Iraq invasion he was publicly a man of the left. His sons Simon and Stephen formed a production company in 2010 to make adaptations of his work a family business. His first marriage had ended in divorce in 1971 after his affair with Susie Kennaway, the wife of his friend, the Scottish novelist James Kennaway. The episode inspired \u003ci\u003eThe Naive and Sentimental Lover\u003c/i\u003e, the only le Carré novel that doesn’t qualify as a thriller. In 1972 he married Jane Eustace, who had worked in publishing and introduced him to Bob Gottlieb, his longtime editor at Knopf. The couple lived in London and Cornwall, where they both died within months of each other. Both had been suffering from cancer, though it was pneumonia that felled le Carré in December 2020. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a reply to an editor at the \u003ci\u003eHampstead \u0026amp; Highgate Express \u003c/i\u003ewho asked him to review Greene’s late novel \u003ci\u003eThe Human Factor\u003c/i\u003e, le Carré said Greene was “a great writer who has, as he says himself, to put up with longevity.” Time brings the risk of the “off book.” Only after le Carré turned eighty did the novels take on an uncharacteristic slightness. He was writing till the end. After \u003ci\u003eAgent Running in the Field\u003c/i\u003e (2019), a novel with parallels to the Edward Snowden affair, he started a book with the working title \u003ci\u003eThe George Smiley Years\u003c/i\u003e, which included an encounter between Smiley and his arch-nemesis and foil Karla, after the Russian spy chief’s defection to the West. Smiley was last seen in \u003ci\u003eA Legacy of Spies\u003c/i\u003e (2017), in which the children of characters from \u003ci\u003eThe Spy Who Came in from the Cold \u003c/i\u003eand \u003ci\u003eTinker Tailor\u003c/i\u003e make inquiries about what happened to their parents. Smiley shows up at the end, reading German literature and pleased that the divided Europe of his spy years has now achieved a peaceful union. Le Carré was aghast at Brexit and sought Irish citizenship (Ronnie Cornwell’s mother Bessie was Irish). The sight of another hot war on the European frontier would have crushed him. Responding to a Soviet reviewer who called him an “apologist” for the Cold War, le Carré insisted that his view was the opposite and was in fact “the greatest heresy”: “there is no victory and no virtue in the Cold War, only a condition of human illness and political misery.” A critic looking for simple binaries would be better off reading novels about “the hyena who stalks the capitalist deserts,” James Bond, a character with “the one piece of equipment without which not even his formula would work: an entirely evil enemy.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href="https://www.bookforum.com/contributor/christian-lorentzen" title="Contributions by Christian Lorentzen"\u003eChristian Lorentzen\u003c/a\u003e is a writer living in Brooklyn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n        \n        \n\n        \n    ',
